[A wonderful introduction into machine learning, and how to choose the right algorithm or family of algorithms for the task at hand.](https://blogs.sas.com/content/subconsciousmusings/2017/04/12/machine-learning-algorithm-use/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=analytics-global&utm_content=US_interests-conversions)


## VARIOUS MODEL FAMILIES

## WEAKLY SUPERVISED



1. [Text classification with extremely small datasets](https://towardsdatascience.com/text-classification-with-extremely-small-datasets-333d322caee2), relies heavily on feature engineering methods such as number of hashtags, number of punctuations and other insights that are really good for this type of text.
2. A great [review paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3adc/fd254b271bcc2fb7e2a62d750db17e6c2c08.pdf) for weakly supervision, discusses:
    1. Incomplete supervision
    2. Inaccurate
    3. Inexact
    4. Active learning

6. [Out of distribution generalization using test-time training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13231) - Test-time training turns a single unlabeled test instance into a self-supervised learning problem, on which we update the model parameters before making a prediction on this instance. 
7. [Learning Deep Networks from Noisy Labels with Dropout Regularization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.03419.pdf) - Large datasets often have unreliable labelsâsuch as those obtained from Amazonâs Mechanical Turk or social media platformsâand classifiers trained on mislabeled datasets often exhibit poor performance. We present a simple, effective technique for accounting for label noise when training deep neural networks. We augment a standard deep network with a softmax layer that models the label noise statistics. Then, we train the deep network and noise model jointly via end-to-end stochastic gradient descent on the (perhaps mislabeled) dataset. The augmented model is overdetermined, so in order to encourage the learning of a non-trivial noise model, we apply dropout regularization to the weights of the noise model during training. Numerical experiments on noisy versions of the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets show that the proposed dropout technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
8. [Distill to label weakly supervised instance labeling using knowledge distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12926.pdf) - âWeakly supervised instance labeling using only image-level labels, in lieu of expensive fine-grained pixel annotations, is crucial in several applications including medical image analysis. In contrast to conventional instance segmentation scenarios in computer vision, the problems that we consider are characterized by a small number of training images and non-local patterns that lead to the diagnosis. In this paper, we explore the use of multiple instance learning (MIL) to design an instance label generator under this weakly supervised setting. Motivated by the observation that an MIL model can handle bags of varying sizes, we propose to repurpose an MIL model originally trained for bag-level classification to produce reliable predictions for single instances, i.e., bags of size 1. To this end, we introduce a novel regularization strategy based on virtual adversarial training for improving MIL training, and subsequently develop a knowledge distillation technique for repurposing the trained MIL model. Using empirical studies on colon cancer and breast cancer detection from histopathological images, we show that the proposed approach produces high-quality instance-level prediction and significantly outperforms state-of-the MIL methods.â

    Back translation consists of translating a sentence into some other intermediate language (e.g. French) and then translating it back to the original language (English in this case). The authors trained an English-to-French and French-to-English system on the WMT 14 corpus.


    TF-IDF word replacement replaces words in a sentence at random based on the TF-IDF scores of each word (words with a lower TF-IDF have a higher probability of being replaced).

We show that MixMatch obtains state-of-the-art results by a large margin across many datasets and labeled data amounts
10. ReMixMatch - [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.09785.pdf) is really good. âWe improve the recently-proposed âMixMatchâ semi-supervised learning algorithm by introducing two new techniques: distribution alignment and augmentation anchoringâ
11. [FixMatch](https://amitness.com/2020/03/fixmatch-semi-supervised/) - FixMatch is a recent semi-supervised approach by Sohn et al. from Google Brain that improved the state of the art in semi-supervised learning(SSL). It is a simpler combination of previous methods such as UDA and ReMixMatch.  \

## ACTIVE LEARNING



1. If you need to start somewhere start [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/active-learning) - types of AL, the methodology, examples, sample selection functions.
2. A thorough [review paper](http://burrsettles.com/pub/settles.activelearning.pdf) about AL

4. [Choose your model first, then do AL, from lighttag](https://www.lighttag.io/blog/active-learning-optimization-is-not-imporvement/)
    1. The alternative is Query by committee - Importantly, the active learning method we presented above is the most naive form of what is called "uncertainty sampling" where we chose to sample based on how uncertain our model was. An alternative approach, called Query by Committee, maintains a collection of models (the committee) and selecting the most "controversial" data point to label next, that is one where the models disagreed on. Using such a committee may allow us to overcome the restricted hypothesis a single model can express, though at the onset of a task we still have no way of knowing what hypothesis we should be using.

### ZERO SHOT LEARNING



1. [Instead of using class labels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBnCcr-3bXc), we use some kind of vector representation for the classes, taken from a co-occurrence-after-svd or word2vec. - quite clever. This enables us to figure out if a new unseen class is near one of the known supervised classes. KNN can be used or some other distance-based classifier. Can we use word2vec for similarity measurements of new classes?  \

When I used to do consulting, Iâd always seek to understand an organizationâs context for developing data projects, based on these considerations:



*   _Strategy_: What is the organization trying to do (_objective_) and what can it change to do it better (_levers_)?
*   _Data_: Is the organization capturing necessary data and making it available?
*   _Analytics_: What kinds of insights would be useful to the organization?
*   _Implementation_: What organizational capabilities does it have?
*   _Maintenance_: What systems are in place to track changes in the operational environment?
*   _Constraints_: What constraints need to be considered in each of the above areas?

([how does reshape work?)](http://anie.me/numpy-reshape-transpose-theano-dimshuffle/) -  a shape of (2,4,6) is like a tree of 2->4 and each one has more leaves 4->6. 

As far as i can tell, reshape effectively flattens the tree and divide it again to a new tree, but the total amount of inputs needs to stay the same. 2*4*6 = 4*2*3*2 for example

**code:**


    **import numpy**


    **rng = numpy.random.RandomState(234)**


    **a = rng.randn(2,3,10)**


    **print(a.shape)**


    **print(a)**


    **b = numpy.reshape(a, (3,5,-1))**

We'll explore three approaches that make use of existing libraries, but still benefit from the parallelism provided by Spark.

        These approaches are:

*   Grid Search
*   Cross Validation
*   Sampling (random, chronological subsets of data across clusters)
    20. Github [spark-sklearn ](https://github.com/databricks/spark-sklearn)(needs to be compared to what spark has internally)
        6. [Ref: ](https://mapr.com/blog/predicting-airbnb-listing-prices-scikit-learn-and-apache-spark/)It's worth pausing here to note that the architecture of this approach is different than that used by MLlib in Spark. Using spark-sklearn, we're simply distributing the cross-validation run of each model (with a specific combination of hyperparameters) across each Spark executor. Spark MLlib, on the other hand, will distribute the internals of the actual learning algorithms across the cluster.
        7. The main advantage of spark-sklearn is that it enables leveraging the very rich set of [machine learning](https://mapr.com/ebook/machine-learning-logistics/) algorithms in scikit-learn. These algorithms do not run natively on a cluster (although they can be parallelized on a single machine) and by adding Spark, we can unlock a lot more horsepower than could ordinarily be used.
        8. Using [spark-sklearn](https://github.com/databricks/spark-sklearn) is a straightforward way to throw more CPU at any machine learning problem you might have. We used the package to reduce the time spent searching and reduce the error for our estimator

## [Difference between](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/665/whats-the-difference-between-probability-and-statistics) 



*   **I.e, _Probability_ deals with predicting the likelihood of future events, while _statistics_ involves the analysis of the frequency of past events. **  
*   The **problems **considered by probability and statistics are **inverse to each other**. 
*   In probability theory we_<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> consider some underlying process which has some randomness or uncertainty modeled by random variables, and we figure out what happens.</span>_

**=> Underlying process + randomness and random variables -> what happens next?**



*    In statistics we _<span style="text-decoration:underline;">observe something that has happened, and try to figure out what underlying process would explain those observations.</span>_

**=>** **observe what happened -> what is the underlying process?**



*   **Finally, probability **theory is mainly concerned with the **deductive **part, **statistics **with the **inductive **part of modeling processes with uncertainty

*   what are the known facts? Inherent in both probability and statistics is a [population](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-population-in-statistics-3126308), 
*   every individual we are interested in studying, and a sample, consisting of the individuals that are selected from the population.
*   **in probability:** would start with us knowing everything about the composition of a population, and then would ask, âWhat is the likelihood that a selection, or sample, from the population, has certain characteristics?â
*   **In statistics**: we have no knowledge about the types of socks in the drawer. we infer properties about the population on the basis of a random sample. 

Some [calculations ](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/probability.html)to get you into probability:



*   Finding out the probability of an event
*   Of two consecutive events (multiplication)
*   Of several events (sum)

# [FEATURE](http://www.biostat.umn.edu/~will/6470stuff/Class09-12/Handout09.pdf) TYPES 

**Discrete **



*   **Numbers **
*   **Categorical**
*   **Categorical **data are variables that contain label values rather than numeric values.

    The number of possible values is often limited to a fixed set.

*   **Categorical **variables are often called [nominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_category).
*   labels, usually discrete values such as gender, country of origin, marital status, high-school graduate

**Continuous (**the opposite of discrete**):** real-number values, measured on a continuous scale: height, weight. 

**In order to compute a regression, categorical predictors must be re-expressed as numeric: some form of indicator variables (0/1) with a separate indicator for each level of the factor. **

**Discrete with many values are often treated as continuous, i.e. zone numbers - > binary**

    CORRELATION VS COVARIANCE



1. [Correlation is between -1 to 1, covariance is -inf to inf, units in covariance affect the scale, so correlation is preferred, it is normalized.](https://towardsdatascience.com/correlation-coefficient-clearly-explained-f034d00b66ac) \
**Correlation** is a measure of association. Correlation is used for bivariate analysis. It is a measure of how well the two variables are related. \
**Covariance** is also a measure of association. Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables.

Too many scenarios where the correlation is 0. This makes me wonder if I missed somethingâ¦ (Excerpt from the [image by Denis Boigelot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence))

**Regression**

In case of an regression, the ppscore uses the mean absolute error (MAE) as the underlying evaluation metric (MAE_model). The best possible score of the MAE is 0 and higher is worse. As a baseline score, we calculate the MAE of a naive model (MAE_naive) that always predicts the median of the target column. The PPS is the result of the following normalization (and never smaller than 0):

PPS = 1 - (MAE_model / MAE_naive)

**Classification**

If the task is a classification, we compute the weighted F1 score (wF1) as the underlying evaluation metric (F1_model). The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst score at 0. The relative contribution of precision and recall to the F1 score are equal. The weighted F1 takes into account the precision and recall of all classes weighted by their support as described [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html). As a baseline score (F1_naive), we calculate the weighted F1 score for a model that always predicts the most common class of the target column (F1_most_common) and a model that predicts random values (F1_random). F1_naive is set to the maximum of F1_most_common and F1_random. The PPS is the result of the following normalization (and never smaller than 0):

PPS = (F1_model - F1_naive) / (1 - F1_naive)


## MUTUAL INFORMATION COEFFICIENT

[Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3325791/) - we present a measure of dependence for two-variable relationships: the maximal information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide range of associations both functional and not, and for functional relationships provides a score that roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2) of the data relative to the regression function.

**Computing** **MIC**

(A) For each pair (x,y), the MIC algorithm finds the x-by-y grid with the highest induced mutual information. (B) The algorithm normalizes the mutual information scores and compiles a matrix that stores, for each resolution, the best grid at that resolution and its normalized score. (C) The normalized scores form the characteristic matrix, which can be visualized as a surface; MIC corresponds to the highest point on this surface. 

In this example, there are many grids that achieve the highest score. The star in (B) marks a sample grid achieving this score, and the star in (C) marks that grid's corresponding location on the surface.


    

[Mutual information classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif.html) - Estimate mutual information for a discrete target variable.

Mutual information (MI) [[1]](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif.html#r50b872b699c4-1) between two random variables is a non-negative value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher values mean higher dependency.

The function relies on nonparametric methods based on entropy estimation from k-nearest neighbors distances as described in [[2]](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif.html#r50b872b699c4-2) and [[3]](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif.html#r50b872b699c4-3). Both methods are based on the idea originally proposed in [[4]](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.mutual_info_classif.html#r50b872b699c4-4).

[MI score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mutual_info_score.html) - Mutual Information between two clusterings.

The Mutual Information is a measure of the similarity between two labels of the same data. 

[Adjusted MI score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score.html#sklearn.metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score) - Adjusted Mutual Information between two clusterings.

Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) is an adjustment of the Mutual Information (MI) score to account for chance. It accounts for the fact that the MI is generally higher for two clusterings with a larger number of clusters, regardless of whether there is actually more information shared.

This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching label_true with label_pred will return the same score value. This can be useful to measure the agreement of two independent label assignments strategies on the same dataset when the real ground truth is not known

[Normalized MI score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score.html#sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score) - Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is a normalization of the Mutual Information (MI) score to scale the results between 0 (no mutual information) and 1 (perfect correlation). In this function, mutual information is normalized by some generalized mean of H(labels_true) and H(labels_pred)), defined by the average_method.

    17. (selection) **ANOVA:** ANOVA stands for Analysis of variance. It is similar to LDA except for the fact that it is operated using one or more categorical independent features and one continuous dependent feature. It provides a statistical test of whether the means of several groups are equal or not.

    19. Wrapper methods:
        1. **Forward Selection:** Forward selection is an iterative method in which we start with having no feature in the model. In each iteration, we keep adding the feature which best improves our model till an addition of a new variable does not improve the performance of the model.
        2. **Backward Elimination:** In backward elimination, we start with all the features and removes the least significant feature at each iteration which improves the performance of the model. We repeat this until no improvement is observed on removal of features.
        3. **Recursive Feature elimination:** It is a greedy optimization algorithm which aims to find the best performing feature subset. It repeatedly creates models and keeps aside the best or the worst performing feature at each iteration. It constructs the next model with the left features until all the features are exhausted. It then ranks the features based on the order of their elimination.

1. [Max_features in tf idf](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46118910/scikit-learn-vectorizer-max-features) -Sometimes it is not effective to transform the whole vocabulary, as the data may have some exceptionally rare words, which, if passed to TfidfVectorizer().fit(), will add unwanted dimensions to inputs in the future. One of the appropriate techniques in this case, for instance, would be to print out word frequences accross documents and then set a certain threshold for them. Imagine you have set a threshold of 50, and your data corpus consists of 100 words. After looking at the word frequences 20 words occur less than 50 times. Thus, you set max_features=80 and you are good to go. If max_features is set to None, then the whole corpus is considered during the TF-IDFtransformation. Otherwise, if you pass, say, 5 to max_features, that would mean creating a feature matrix out of the most 5 frequent words accross text documents.

1. [Using RF and other methods, really good](https://towardsdatascience.com/explaining-feature-importance-by-example-of-a-random-forest-d9166011959e)
2. [Non parametric feature impact and importance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04750) - while there are nonparametric feature selection algorithms, they typically provide feature rankings, rather than measures of impact or importance.In this paper, we give mathematical definitions of feature impact and importance, derived from partial dependence curves, that operate directly on the data. 
3. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf), [blog post](https://www.oreilly.com/learning/introduction-to-local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations-lime)): ([GITHUB](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime/blob/master/README.md)) how to "explain the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction." \
 \
they want to understand the reasons behind the predictions, itâs a new field that says that many 'feature importance' measures shouldnât be used. i.e., in a linear regression model, a feature can have an importance rank of 50 (for example), in a comparative model where you duplicate that feature 50 times, each one will have 1/50 importance and wonât be selected for the top K, but it will still be one of the most important features. so new methods needs to be developed to understand feature importance. this one has git code as well.

    Several github notebook examples: [binary case](https://marcotcr.github.io/lime/tutorials/Lime%20-%20basic%20usage%2C%20two%20class%20case.html), [multi class](https://marcotcr.github.io/lime/tutorials/Lime%20-%20multiclass.html), [cont and cat features](https://marcotcr.github.io/lime/tutorials/Tutorial%20-%20continuous%20and%20categorical%20features.html), there are many more for images in the github link.


    âIntuitively, an explanation is a local linear approximation of the model's behaviour. While the model may be very complex globally, it is easier to approximate it around the vicinity of a particular instance. While treating the model as a black box, we perturb the instance we want to explain and learn a sparse linear model around it, as an explanation. The figure below illustrates the intuition for this procedure. The model's decision function is represented by the blue/pink background, and is clearly nonlinear. The bright red cross is the instance being explained (let's call it X). We sample instances around X, and weight them according to their proximity to X (weight here is indicated by size). We then learn a linear model (dashed line) that approximates the model well in the vicinity of X, but not necessarily globally. For more information, read our paper, or take a look at this blog post.â \

8. [âcalibrated classifier cv in sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV.html#sklearn.calibration.CalibratedClassifierCV) - The method to use for calibration. Can be âsigmoidâ which corresponds to Plattâs method or âisotonicâ which is a non-parametric approach. It is not advised to use isotonic calibration with too few calibration samples (&lt;<1000) since it tends to overfit. Use sigmoids (Plattâs calibration) in this case.  \
However, not all classifiers provide well-calibrated probabilities, some being over-confident while others being under-confident. Thus, a separate calibration of predicted probabilities is often desirable as a postprocessing. This example illustrates two different methods for this calibration and evaluates the quality of the returned probabilities using Brierâs score

6. [How Can We Know When Language Models Know? This paper is about calibration.](http://phontron.com/paper/jiang20lmcalibration.pdf) \
âRecent works have shown that language models (LM) capture different types of knowledge regarding facts or common sense. However, because no model is perfect, they still fail to provide appropriate answers in many cases. In this paper, we ask the question âhow can we know when language models know, with confidence, the answer to a particular query?â We examine this question from the point of view of calibration, the property of a probabilistic modelâs predicted probabilities actually being well correlated with the probability of correctness. We first examine a state-ofthe-art generative QA model, T5, and examine whether its probabilities are well calibrated, finding the answer is a relatively emphatic no. We then examine methods to calibrate such models to make their confidence scores correlate better with the likelihood of correctness through fine-tuning, post-hoc probability modification, or adjustment of the predicted outputs or inputs. Experiments on a diverse range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. We also perform analysis to study the strengths and limitations of these methods, shedding light on further improvements that may be made in methods for calibrating LMs.â


# MULTI LABEL CLASSIFICATION

(what is?) [Multilabel classification](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/devel/html/multilabel/index.html) is a classification problem where multiple target labels can be assigned to each observation instead of only one like in multiclass classification.

Two different approaches exist for multilabel classification:



*    _Problem transformation methods_ try to transform the multilabel classification into binary or multiclass classification problems. 
*   _Algorithm adaptation methods_ adapt multiclass algorithms so they can be applied directly to the problem.

I.e., the [Two approaches](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr-tutorial/devel/html/multilabel/index.html) are: 



*   Use a classifier that does multi label
*   Use any classifier with a wrapper that compares each two labels

great [PDF](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/jesse/talks/Multilabel-Part01.pdf) that explains about multi label classification and especially metrics, [part 2 here](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/jesse/talks/Multilabel-Part02.pdf)

[An awesome Paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.104.9401&rep=rep1&type=pdf) that explains all of these methods in detail, also available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273859036_Multi-Label_Classification_An_Overview)!

PT1: for each sample select one label, remove all others.

PT2: remove every sample which has multi labels.

PT3: for every combo of labels create a single-label, i.e. A&B, A&C etc..

PT4: (most common) create L datasets, for each label learn a binary representation, i.e., is it there or not.

(What are?) probabilities in a distribution always add up to 1.

## Gaussian \ Normal Distribution

[â if you collect data and it is not normal, âyou need to collect more dataâ](https://www.isixsigma.com/topic/normal-distributions-why-does-it-matter/)

[Beautiful graphs](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/116550/why-do-we-have-to-assume-normality-for-a-one-sample-t-test)

[The normal distribution is popular for two reasons:](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-use-the-normal-distribution-The-normal-is-an-approximation-Why-dont-we-use-a-simpler-distribution-with-simpler-numbers-to-memorize-If-it-is-an-approximation-does-it-have-to-be-so-specific)



1. It is the most common distribution in nature (as distributions go)
2. An enormous number of statistical relationships become clear and tractable if one assumes the normal.

Sure, nothing in real life exactly matches the Normal. But it is uncanny how many things come close.

**this is partly due to the Central Limit Theorem, which says that if you average enough unrelated things, you eventually get the Normal.**



*   the **Normal distribution** in statistics is a special world in which the math is straightforward and **all the parts fit together in a way that is easy to understand and interpret.**
*   It may not exactly match the real world, but it is close enough that this one **simplifying assumption allows you to predict lots of things**, and the **predictions are often pretty reasonable.**
*   statistically convenient. 
*   represented by basic statistics
    *   **average**
    *   **variance **(or standard deviation) - the average of what's left when you take away the average, but to the power of 2.

In a statistical test, you need the data to be normal to guarantee that your p-values are accurate with your given sample size.

If the data are not normal, your sample size may or may not be adequate, and it may be difficult for you to know which is true.

[The Box-Cox transformation is a useful family of transformations. ](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda336.htm)



*   Many **statistical tests** and intervals are based on the **assumption of normality**. 
*   The assumption of normality often **leads to tests that are simple**, mathematically tractable, and powerful compared to tests that do not make the normality assumption. 
*   **Unfortunately, many real data sets are in fact not approximately normal. **
*   However, an **appropriate transformation** of a data set can often yield a data set that does follow **approximately a normal distribution**.
*    This **increases the applicability and usefulness** of statistical techniques **based on the** **normality assumption**.

**IMPORTANT:!! After a transformation _(c)_, we need to measure of the normality of the resulting transformation (d) . **



*   One measure is to compute the correlation coefficient of a [normal probability plot](http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/normprpl.htm) **=> (d).** 
*   The correlation is computed between the vertical and horizontal axis variables of the probability plot and is a convenient measure of the linearity of the probability plot 
*   In other words: **the more linear the probability plot, the better a normal distribution fits the data!**

[*NOTE: another useful link that explains it with figures, but i did not read it.](http://blog.minitab.com/blog/applying-statistics-in-quality-projects/how-could-you-benefit-from-a-box-cox-transformation)

**GUARANTEED NORMALITY?**



*   NO!
*   This is because it actually does not really check for normality;
*   the method checks for the smallest standard deviation.
*   The assumption is that among all transformations with Lambda values between -5 and +5, transformed data has the highest likelihood â but not a guarantee â to be normally distributed when standard deviation is the smallest. 
*   it is absolutely necessary to always check the transformed data for normality using a probability plot. **(d)**

**+ **Additionally, the Box-Cox Power transformation only works if all the data is positive and greater than 0.

**+** achieved easily by adding a constant âcâ to all data such that it all becomes positive before it is transformed. The transformation equation is then:

## MANN-WHITNEY U TEST

([what is?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test)) - the **MannâWhitney _U_ test**  is a [nonparametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics) [test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_test) of the [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis) that it is equally likely that a randomly selected value from one sample will be less than or greater than a randomly selected value from a second sample.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In other words: This test can be used to determine whether two _independent_ samples were selected from populations having the same distribution. </span>**

Unlike the _[t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-test)_ it does not require the assumption of [normal distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution). It is nearly as efficient as the _t_-test on normal distributions.

## SOFTMAX

2. [Softmax and negative likelihood (NLL)](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2017/08/13/softmax-and-the-negative-log-likelihood/)
3. [Softmax vs cross entropy](https://www.quora.com/Is-the-softmax-loss-the-same-as-the-cross-entropy-loss#) - Softmax loss and cross-entropy loss terms are used interchangeably in industry. Technically, there is no term as such Softmax loss. people use the term "softmax loss" when referring to "cross-entropy loss". The softmax classifier is a linear classifier that uses the cross-entropy loss function. In other words, the gradient of the above function tells a softmax classifier how exactly to update its weights using some optimization like [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).

    The softmax() part simply normalises your network predictions so that they can be interpreted as probabilities. Once your network is predicting a probability distribution over labels for each input, the log loss is equivalent to the cross entropy between the true label distribution and the network predictions. As the name suggests, softmax function is a âsoftâ version of max function. Instead of selecting one maximum value, it breaks the whole (1) with maximal element getting the largest portion of the distribution, but other smaller elements getting some of it as well.


    This property of softmax function that it outputs a probability distribution makes it suitable for probabilistic interpretation in classification tasks.


    Cross entropy indicates the distance between what the model believes the output distribution should be, and what the original distribution is. Cross entropy measure is a widely used alternative of squared error. It is used when node activations can be understood as representing the probability that each hypothesis might be true, i.e. when the output is a probability distribution. Thus it is used as a loss function in neural networks which have softmax activations in the output layer.

**Understanding what is the next stage in DL (& ML) algorithm development: basic approach - [Andrew NG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1ka6a13S9I) on youtube**

Terms: training, validation, test.

Split: training & validation 70%, test 30%


## Procedure: crossfold training and validation, or further split 70% to training and validation.

**BIAS - Situation 1 - doing much worse than human: **

Human expert: 1% error

Training set error: 5% error (test on train)

Validation set error: 6% error (test on validation or CFV)

Conclusion: there is a BIAS between human expert and training set

Solution: 1. Train deeper or bigger\larger networks, 2. train longer, 3. May needs more data to get to the human expert level, Or 4. New model architecture.

**VARIANCE - Situation 2 - validation set not close to training set error:**

Human expert: 1% error

Training set error: 2% error

Validation set error: 6% error

Conclusion: there is a VARIANCE problem, i.e. OVERFITTING, between training and validation.

Solution: 1. Early stopping, 2. Regularization or 3. get more data, or 4. New model architecture.

**Situation 3 - both:**

Human expert: 1% error

Training set error: 5% error

Validation set error: 10% error

Conclusion: both problems occur, i.e., BIAS as and VARIANCE .

Solution:  do it all.

Underfitting = Get more data 

Overfitting = Early stop, regularization, reason: models detail & noise.



*   Happens more in non parametric (and non linear) algorithms such as decision trees.

**Bottom line, bigger model or more data will solve most issues.**

IMPORTANT! For Test Train efficiency when the data is from different distributions:

E.g: **TRAIN**: 50K hours of voice chatter as the train set for a DLN, **TEST: **10H for specific voice-based problem, i.e, taxi chatter.

**Best practice:** better to divide the validation & test from the same distribution, i.e. the 10H set.

**Reason:** improving scores on validation which is from a diff distribution will not be the same quality as improving scores on a validation set originated from the actual distribution of the problemâs data, i.e., 10H.

**NOTE: **Unlike the usual supervised learning, where all the data is from the same distribution, where we split the training to train and validation (cfv).

**[Situation 4](https://youtu.be/F1ka6a13S9I?t=47m26s): **However, when there are 2 distributions itâs possible to extend the division of the training set to validation_training and training, and the test to validation and test.

**Split: ** Train, Valid_Train = 48K\2K & Valid, Test, 5K & 5K.

![alt_text](images/image57.png "image_tooltip")


So situation 1 stays the same, 

Situation 2 is Valid_Train error (train_dev)

Situation 3 is Valid_Test error - need more data, **data synthesis **- tweak test to be similar to train data, new architecture as a solution

Situation 4 is now Test set error - get more data

    TRAINING METHODOLOGIES



1. Train test split
2. Cross validation
3. Transfer learning - using a pre existing classifier similar to your domain, usually trained on millions of samples. fine-tuned on new data in order to create a new classifier that utilizes that information in the new domain. Examples such as w2v or classic resnet fine-tuning.
4. Bootstrapping training- using a similar dataset, such as yelp, with 5 stars to create a pos/neg sentiment classifier based on 1 star and 5 stars. Finally using that to label or sample select from an unlabelled dataset, in order to create a new classifier or just to sample for annotation etc.
5. [Student-teacher paradigm](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/from-visual-recognition-to-reasoning/) (facebook), using a big labelled dataset to train a teacher classifier, predicting on unlabelled data, choosing the best classified examples based on probability, using those to train a new student model, finally fine-tune on the labeled dataset to create a more robust model, which is expected to know the unlabelled dataset and the labelled dataset with higher accuracy. With respect to the fully supervised teacher model / baseline.

**â<code>[The training](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/19048/what-is-the-difference-between-test-set-and-validation-set) set is used to fit the models; the validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection; the test set is used for assessment of the generalization error of the final chosen model. Ideally, the test set should be kept in a "vault," and be brought out only at the end of the data analysis"</code></strong>



*   Random Split tests 66\33 - problem: variance each time we rerun.
*   Multiple times random split tests - problem: samples may not be included in train\test or selected multiple times.
*   Cross validation - pretty good, diff random seed results in diff mean accuracy, variance due to randomness
*   Multiple cross validation - accounts for the randomness of the CV
*   Statistical significance ( t-test)  on multi CV - are two samples drawn from the same population? (no difference). If âyesâ, not significant, even if the mean and std deviations differ.

Finally, When in doubt, use k-fold cross validation (k=10) and use multiple runs of k-fold cross validation with statistical significance tests.

[Out of fold](https://machinelearningmastery.com/out-of-fold-predictions-in-machine-learning/) - leave unseen data, do cross fold on that. Good for ensembles.

[Systematic Investigation of imbalance effects in CNNâs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05381), with several observations. This is crucial when training networks, because in real life you donât always get a balanced DS.

They recommend the following: 



1. (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is **detrimental**;
2. (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was **oversampling**; 
3. (iii) **oversampling **should be applied to the level that totally **eliminates the imbalance**, whereas undersampling can perform better when the imbalance is only removed to some extent; 
4. (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling **does not necessarily cause overfitting of CNNs; **
5. (v) **thresholding **should be applied to compensate for **prior class probabilities** when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.

General Rules: 



1. Many samples - undersampling
2. Few  samples  - over sampling
3. Consider random and non-random schemes
4. Different sample rations, instead of 1:1 (proof? papers?)

Balancing data sets ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oversampling_and_undersampling_in_data_analysis), [scikit learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn) & [examples in SKLEARN](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/auto_examples/index.html)):



1. Oversampling the minority class
    1. (Random) duplication of samples
    2. SMOTE [(in weka + needs to be installed ](http://www.jair.org/media/953/live-953-2037-jair.pdf)&[ paper) ](http://www.jair.org/media/953/live-953-2037-jair.pdf)- find k nearest neighbours, 

    New_Sample = (random num in [0,1] ) * vec(ki,current_sample) 

*   **(in weka) **The nearestNeighbors parameter says how many nearest neighbor instances (surrounding the currently considered instance) are used to build an in between synthetic instance. The default value is 5. Thus the attributes of 5 nearest neighbors of a real existing instance are used to compute a new synthetic one.
*   **(in weka) **The percentage parameter says how many synthetic instances are created based on the number of the class with less instances (by default - you can also use the majority class by setting the -Coption). The default value is 100. This means if you have 25 instances in your minority class, again 25 instances are created synthetically from these (using their nearest neighbours' values). With 200% 50 synthetic instances are created and so on.
    3. ADASYN - shifts the classification boundary to the minority class, synthetic data generated for majority class.
2. Undersampling the majority class
    4. Remove samples
    5. Cluster centroids - replaces a cluster of samples (k-means) with a centroid.
    6. Tomek links - cleans overlapping samples between classes in the majority class.
    7. Penalizing the majority class during training
3. Combined over and under (hybrid) - i.e., SMOTE and tomek/ENN
4. Ensemble sampling 
    8. EasyEnsemble
    9. BalanceCascade
5. Dont balance, try algorithms that perform well with unbalanced DS
    10. Decision trees - C4.5\5\CART\Random Forest

The usual suspect would be those nasty integrals when computing the normalizing constant of the distribution, especially in Bayesian inference. Now Gibbs Sampler can draw samples from any distribution, provided you can provide all of the conditional distributions of the joint distribution analytically.

# DATASET CONFIDENCE



1. [Dataset cartography mapping and diagnosing datasets with training dynamics - ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10795)Large datasets have become commonplace in NLP research. However, the increased emphasis on data quantity has made it challenging to assess the quality of data. We introduce Data Maps---a model-based tool to characterize and diagnose datasets. We leverage a largely ignored source of information: the behavior of the model on individual instances during training (training dynamics) for building data maps. This yields two intuitive measures for each example---the model's confidence in the true class, and the variability of this confidence across epochs---obtained in a single run of training. Experiments across four datasets show that these model-dependent measures reveal three distinct regions in the data map, each with pronounced characteristics. First, our data maps show the presence of "ambiguous" regions with respect to the model, which contribute the most towards out-of-distribution generalization. Second, the most populous regions in the data are "easy to learn" for the model, and play an important role in model optimization. Finally, data maps uncover a region with instances that the model finds "hard to learn"; these often correspond to labeling errors. Our results indicate that a shift in focus from quantity to quality of data could lead to robust models and improved out-of-distribution generalization.

*   data has varying scales 
*   Normalize between range 0 to 1.
    *   When the algorithm you are using **does not** make assumptions about the distribution of your data, such as k-nearest neighbors and artificial neural networks.
*   Standardize, mean of 0 and a std of 1:
    *   When the algorithm assumes a gaussian dist, such as linear regression, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis. LR, LogR, LDA

    **Generally, it is a good idea to standardize data that has a Gaussian (bell curve) distribution and normalize otherwise.


4. In general terms, we should test 0,1 or -1,1 empirically and possibly match the range to the NN gates/activation function etc.


# REGULARIZATION

**Youtube? [Watch this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO4ZirJh9ds) Also explains about iso surfaces, lp norm, sparseness.**

**(what is?) **[Regularization (in linear regression](https://datanice.github.io/machine-learning-101-what-is-regularization-interactive.html)) - to find the best model we define a loss or cost function that describes how well the model fits the data, and try minimize it. For a complex model that fits even the noise, i.e., over fitted, we penalize it by adding a complexity term that would add BIGGER LOSS for more complex models.



*   Bigger lambda -> high complexity models (**deg 3**) are ruled out,** more punishment.**
*   Smaller lambda -> models with high training error are rules out. I.e.,  linear model on non linear data?, i.e., **deg 1**.
*   Optimal is in between (**deg 2**)

**(Difference between? And features of) **[L1 vs L2](http://www.chioka.in/differences-between-l1-and-l2-as-loss-function-and-regularization/) as loss function and regularization.



*   **L1 - **moves the regressor faster, feature selection by sparsing coefficients (zeroing them), with sparse algorithms it is computationally efficient, with others no, so use L2.
*   **L2 -** moves slower, doesn't sparse, computationally efficient.

**Why does L1 lead to sparity?**



*   **[Intuition ](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-L1-regularization-supposed-to-lead-to-sparsity-than-L2)+ [some mathematical info](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-L1-and-L2-regularization)**
*   L1 & L2 regularization add constraints to the optimization problem. The curve H0 is the hypothesis. The solution is a set of points where the H0 meets the constraints. 
*   In L2 the the hypothesis is tangential to the ||w||_2. The point of intersection has both x1 and x2 components. On the other hand, in L1, due to the nature of ||w||_1, the viable solutions are limited to the corners of the axis, i.e.,  x1. So that the value of x2 = 0. This means that the solution has eliminated the role of x2 leading to sparsity. 
*   This can be extended to a higher dimensions and you can see why L1 regularization leads to solutions to the optimization problem where many of the variables have value 0.  
*   **In other words, L1 regularization leads to sparsity.**
*   Also considered feature selection - although with LibSVM the recommendation is to feature select prior to using the SVM and use L2 instead.

**[L1 sparsity - intuition #2](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-L1-and-L2-regularization)**



*   For simplicity, let's just consider the 1-dimensional case.
*   **L2:**
*   L2-regularized loss function F(x)=f(x)+Î»â¥xâ¥^2 is smooth. 
*   This means that the optimum is the stationary point (0-derivative point). 
*   The stationary point of F can get very small when you increase Î», but it will still** won't be 0 unless fâ²(0)=0.**
*   **L1:**
    *   regularized loss function F(x)=f(x)+Î»â¥xâ¥ is **non-smooth, i.e., a min knee of 0.**
    *   It's not differentiable at 0. 
    *   Optimization theory says that the optimum of a function is either the point with 0-derivative or one of the irregularities (corners, kinks, etc.). So, it's possible that the optimal point of F is 0 even if 0 isn't the stationary point of f.
    *   **In fact, it would be 0 if Î» is large enough (stronger regularization effect). Below is a graphical illustration.**

# VALIDATION


## DATASETS RELIABILITY & CORRECTNESS 

1. [Clever Hans effect](https://thegradient.pub/nlps-clever-hans-moment-has-arrived/?fbclid=IwAR3vSx9EjXcSPhXU3Jyf7aWpTqhbVDARnh3qGpSw0rysv9rLeGyZFFCPnJA) - in relations to cues left in the dataset that models find, instead of actually solving the defined task!



*   Ablating, i.e. removing, part of a model and observing the impact this has on performance is a common method for verifying that the part in question is useful. If performance doesn't go down, then the part is useless and should be removed. Carrying this method over to datasets, it should become common practice to perform dataset ablations, as well, for example:
*   Provide only incomplete input (as done in the reviewed paper): This verifies that the complete input is required. If not, the dataset contains cues that allow taking shortcuts.
*   Shuffle the input: This verifies the importance of word (or sentence) order. If a bag-of-words/sentences gives similar results, even though the task requires sequential reasoning, then the model has not learned sequential reasoning and the dataset contains cues that allow the model to "solve" the task without it.
*   Assign random labels: How much does performance drop if ten percent of instances are relabeled randomly? How much with all random labels? If scores don't change much, the model probably didn't learning anything interesting about the task.
*   Randomly replace content words: How much does performance drop if all noun phrases and/or verb phrases are replaced with random noun phrases and verbs? If not much, the dataset may provide unintended non-content cues, such as sentence length or distribution of function words.

## FAIRNESS, ACCOUNTABILITY & TRANSPARENCY ML



1. FATML [website](https://www.fatml.org/) - The past few years have seen growing recognition that machine learning raises novel challenges for ensuring non-discrimination, due process, and understandability in decision-making. In particular, policymakers, regulators, and advocates have expressed fears about the potentially discriminatory impact of machine learning, with many calling for further technical research into the dangers of inadvertently encoding bias into automated decisions.

    At the same time, there is increasing alarm that the complexity of machine learning may reduce the justification for consequential decisions to âthe algorithm made me do it.â

[Poisoning attacks on fairness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07401.pdf) - Research in adversarial machine learning has shown how the performance of machine learning models can be seriously compromised by injecting even a small fraction of poisoning points into the training data. We empirically show that our attack is effective not only in the white-box setting, in which the attacker has full access to the target model, but also in a more challenging black-box scenario in which the attacks are optimized against a substitute model and then transferred to the target model

There is a way forward -- it is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This manuscript clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare, and computer vision.â

## DEBIASING MODELS



1. [Adversarial removal of demographic features](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06640) - âWe show that demographic information of authors is encoded in -- and can be recovered from -- the intermediate representations learned by text-based neural classifiers. The implication is that decisions of classifiers trained on textual data are not agnostic to -- and likely condition on -- demographic attributes. â \
âwe explore several techniques to improve the effectiveness of the adversarial component. Our main conclusion is a cautionary one: do not rely on the adversarial training to achieve invariant representation to sensitive features.â \

2. [Null It Out: Guarding Protected Attributes by Iterative Nullspace Projection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07667) (paper) , [github](https://github.com/shauli-ravfogel/nullspace_projection), [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xi5HLpvvRE8BqcNBZMyPS4gBa0i0lqZvRebz-AZxAPA/edit) by Shauli et al. - removing biased information such as gender from an embedding space using nullspace projection. \
The objective is this: give a representation of text, for example BERT embeddings of many resumes/CVs, we want to achieve a state where a certain quality, for example a gender representation of the person who wrote this resume is not encoded in X. they used the light version definition for ânot encodedâ, i.e., you cant predict the quality from the representation with a higher than random score, using a linear model. I.e., every linear model you will train, will not be able to predict the personâs gender out of the embedding space and will reach a 50% accuracy. \
This is done by an iterative process that includes. 1. Linear model training to predict the quality of the concept from the representation. 2. Performing âprojection to null spaceâ for the linear classifier, this is an acceptable linear algebra calculation that has a meaning of zeroing the representation from the projection on the separation place that the linear model is representing, making the model useless. I.e., it will always predict the zero vector. This is done iteratively on the neutralized output, i.e., in the second iteration we look for an alternative way to predict the gender out of X, until we reach 50% accuracy (or some other metric you want to measure) at this point we have neutralized all the linear directions in the embedding space, that were predictive to the gender of the author.

    For a matrix W, the null space is a sub-space of all X such that WX=0, i.e., W maps X to the zero vector, this is a linear projection of the zero vector into a subspace. For example you can take a 3d vectors and calculate its projection on XY.

3. Can we extinct predictive samples? Its an open question, Maybe we can use influence functions?

    [Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04730.pdf) - How can we explain the predictions of a blackbox model? In this paper, we use influence functions â a classic technique from robust statistics â to trace a modelâs prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction.


    We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually indistinguishable training-set attacks.

1. [Differential privacy](https://georgianpartners.com/what-is-differential-privacy/) has emerged as a major area of research in the effort to prevent the identification of individuals and private data. It is a mathematical definition for the privacy loss that results to individuals when their private information is used to create AI products. It works by injecting noise into a dataset, during a machine learning training process, or into the output of a machine learning model, without introducing significant adverse effects on data analysis or model performance. It achieves this by calibrating the noise level to the sensitivity of the algorithm. The result is a differentially private dataset or model that cannot be reverse engineered by an attacker, while still providing useful information. Uses BOTLON & EPSILON

# META-LEARNING

[What is?](https://www.automl.org/) Automated Machine Learning provides methods and processes to make Machine Learning available for non-Machine Learning experts, to improve efficiency of Machine Learning and to accelerate research on Machine Learning.

**Personal note**: automl algorithms in this field will bridge the gap and automate several key processes, but it will not allow a practitioner to do serious research or solve business or product problems easily. The importance of this field is to advance each subfield, whether HPO, NAS, etc. these selective novelties can help us solve specific issues, i.e, lets take HPO, we can use it to save time and money on redundant parameter searches, especially when it comes to resource heavy algorithms such as Deep learning (think GPU costs).

**Personal thoughts on optimizations**: be advised that optimizing problems will not guarantee a good result, you may over fit your problem in ways you are not aware of, beyond traditional overfitting and better accuracy doesn't guarantee a better result (for example if your dataset is unbalanced, needs imputing, cleaning, etc.).   \


**Always examine the data and results in order to see if they are correct.**

**[Automl.orgâs github - it has a backup for the following projects.](https://github.com/automl)**

[Automl.org](https://www.automl.org/) is a joint effort between two universitie, freiburg and hannover, their website curates information regarding:



1. HPO - hyper parameter optimization
2. NAS - neural architecture search
3. Meta Learning - learning across datasets, warmstarting of HPO and NAS etc.

Automl aims to automate these processes:



*   Preprocess and clean the data.
*   Select and construct appropriate features.
*   Select an appropriate model family.
*   Optimize model hyperparameters.
*   Postprocess machine learning models.
*   Critically analyze the results obtained.

Historically, AFAIK AutoMLâs birth started with several methods to optimize each one of the previous processes in ml. IINM, [wekaâs paper (2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3719)) was the first step in aggregating these ideas into a first public working solution.

The following is referenced from AutoML.org:

    A balanced confusion matrix is better than one that is either one row of numbers and one of zeros, or a column of numbers and a column of zeros. Therefore an algorithm that outputs a lower classification accuracy but has a better confusion matrix wins.


    # of Positive predictions divided by the total number of positive class values predicted.


    Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)


    Low can be thought of many false positives.


    # of positive predictions divided by the number of positive class values in the test data


    Recall (sensitivity) = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)


    Low can be thought of many false  negatives.

#### Recall



    *   one day, your girlfriend asks you: âSweetie, do you remember all birthday surprises from me?â
    *   This simple question makes your life in danger. To extend your life, you need to **recall** all **10** surprising events from your memory.
    *   So, `recall` is the ratio of a number of **events you can _correctly_ recall** to a number of **all correct events**. If you can recall all **10** events correctly, then, your recall ratio is **1.0** (**100%**). If you can recall **7** events correctly, your recall ratio is **0.7** (**70%**).


#### Precision



    *   For example, you answers **15** times, **10** events are correct and **5** events are wrong. This means you can recall all events but itâs not so `precise`.
    *   So, `precision` is the ratio of a number of **events you can _correctly_ recall** to a number **all events you recall** _(mix of correct and wrong recalls)_. In other words, it is how precise of your recall.
    *   From the previous example (10 real events, 15 answers: 10 correct answers, 5 wrong answers), you get **100%** recall but your precision is only **66.67%** (10 / 15).

[Confusion matrix wise](http://www.kdnuggets.com/faq/precision-recall.html): bottom line is recall (**%** **correct out of positive cases**), right column is precision (% of  POS  predictions) & **% accuracy in diagonal**

(**How to use precision and recall**?) answer by aurelien geron:



*   In a binary classifier, the decision function is the function that produces a score for the positive class. 
*   In a logistic regression classifier, that decision function is simply a linear combination of the input features.
*   If that score is greater than some threshold that you choose, then the classifier "predicts" the positive class, or else it predicts the negative class. 
*   **If you want your model to have high precision (at the cost of a low recall), then you must set the threshold pretty high. This way, the model will only predict the positive class when it is absolutely certain. For example, you may want this if the classifier is selecting videos that are safe for kids: it's better to err on the safe side. **
*   **Conversely, if you want high recall (at the cost of a low precision) then you must use a low threshold. For example, if the classifier is used to detect intruders in a nuclear plant, then you probably want to detect all actual intruders, even if it means getting a lot of false alarms (called "false positives").**
*   If you make a few assumptions about the distribution of the data (i.e., the positive and negative class are separated by a linear boundary plus Gaussian noise), then computing the logistic of the score gives you the probability that the instance belongs to the positive class. A score of 0 corresponds to the 50% probability. So by default, a LogisticClassifier predicts the positive class if it estimates the probability to be greater than 50%. **In general, this sounds like a reasonable default threshold, but really it all depends on what you want to do with the classifier.**
*   If the assumptions I mentioned above were perfect, then if the Logistic Classifier outputs a probability of X% for an instance, it means there is exactly X% chance that it's positive. But in practice, the assumptions are imperfect, so I try to always make it clear that we are talking about an "estimated probability", not an actual probability.


### ROC CURVES

2. [What is ROC AUC and PR AUC and when to use then (i.e for imbalanced data use PRAUC)](http://www.chioka.in/differences-between-roc-auc-and-pr-auc/)
3. [What is AUC (AUROC)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/132777/what-does-auc-stand-for-and-what-is-it)



[(RMSE - what is?)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/56302/what-are-good-rmse-values) -  it is important to recall that RMSE has the same unit as the dependent variable (DV). It means that there is no absolute good or bad threshold, however you can define it based on your DV. For a datum which ranges from **0 to 1000, an RMSE of 0.7 is small,** but if the range goes from** 0 to 1, it is not that small anymore.** However, although the smaller the RMSE, the better,  

[(R^2 vs RMSE)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/142248/difference-between-r-square-and-rmse-in-linear-regression) - R-squared is conveniently scaled between 0 and 1, whereas RMSE is not scaled to any particular values. This can be good or bad; obviously R-squared can be more easily interpreted, but with RMSE we explicitly know how much our predictions deviate, on average, from the actual values in the dataset. So in a way, RMSE tells you more.

I also found this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq8VU5KLmkY) really helpful.

## Concept drift



1. [Some advice on medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/concept-drift-and-model-decay-in-machine-learning-a98a809ea8d4), relabel using latest model (can we even trust it?) retrain after.
2. [Adversarial Validation Approach to Concept Drift Problem in User Targeting Automation Systems at Uber](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03045)  - Previous research on concept drift mostly proposed model retraining after observing performance decreases. However, this approach is suboptimal because the system fixes the problem only after suffering from poor performance on new data. Here, we introduce an adversarial validation approach to concept drift problems in user targeting automation systems. With our approach, the system detects concept drift in new data before making inference, trains a model, and produces predictions adapted to the new data. 
3. Drift estimator between data sets using random forest, formula is in the medium article above, code here at [mlBOX](https://github.com/AxeldeRomblay/MLBox/blob/811dbcb04fc7f5501e82f3e78aa6c119f426ee78/python-package/mlbox/preprocessing/drift/drift_estimator.py)

### MARKOV MODELS

Random vs Stochastic ([here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/114373/whats-the-difference-between-stochastic-and-random) and [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/569951/what-is-the-difference-between-a-random-vector-and-a-stochastic-process)):



*   A **variable **is **'random'**. 
*   A **process **is **'stochastic'**. 

**Apart from this difference the two words are synonyms**

In other words:



*   A **random vector** is a generalization of a **single random variables** to many.
*   A **stochastic process** is a sequence of **random variables**, or a **sequence of random vectors** (and then you have a vector-stochastic process).

([What is a Markov Model?)](http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/ece854/refs/Ramos-Intro-HMM.pdf) A Markov Model is a stochastic(random) model which models temporal or sequential data, i.e., data that are ordered.



*   It provides a way to model the dependencies of current information (e.g. weather) with previous information.
*   It is composed of states, transition scheme between states, and emission of outputs (discrete or continuous).  
*   Several **goals **can be accomplished by using Markov models:  
    *   Learn **statistics **of **sequential data.**  
    *   Do **prediction **or estimation.  
    *   Recognize **patterns**.

([sunny cloudy explanation](http://techeffigytutorials.blogspot.co.il/2015/01/markov-chains-explained.html)) Markov Chains is a probabilistic process, that **relies on the current state to predict the next state. **



*   to be effective the current state has to be dependent on the previous state in some way
*   if it looks cloudy outside, the next state we expect is rain.
*   If the rain starts to subside into cloudiness, the next state will most likely be sunny. 
*   **Not every process has the Markov Property**, such as the Lottery, this weeks winning numbers have no dependence to the previous weeks winning numbers.
1. They show how to build an order 1 markov table of probabilities, predicting the next state given the current. 
2. Then it shows the state diagram built from this table.
3. Then how to build a transition matrix from the 3 states, i.e., from the probabilities in the table
4. Then how to calculate the next state using the âcurrent state vectorâ doing vec*matrix multiplications.
5. Then it talks about the setting always into the rain prediction, and the solution is using two last states in a bigger table of order 2. **He is not really telling us why the probabilities don't change if we add more states, it stays the same as in order 1, just repeating.**

HMM ([what is? And why HIDDEN?)](https://youtu.be/jY2E6ExLxaw?t=27m38s) - the idea is that there are things that you CAN OBSERVE and there are things that you CAN'T OBSERVE. From the things you OBSERVE you want to INFER the things you CAN'T OBSERVE (HIDDEN). I.e., **you play against someone else in a game, you don't see their choice of action, but you see the result.**

This youtube video [part1 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPRoLreU9lA)- explains about the hidden markov model. It shows the visual representation of the model and how we go from that the formula:

It  breaks down the formula to:



*   **transition probability formula** - the probability of going from Zk to Zk+1
*   **emission probability formula ** - the probability of going from Zk to Xk
*   **(Pi) Initial distribution - **the probability of Z1=i for i=1..m

This is the iconic image of a Hidden Markov Model. There is some state (x) that changes with time (markov). And you want to estimate or track it. Unfortunately, you cannot directly observe this state (hidden). That's the hidden part. But, you can observe something correlated with the state (y).

**OBSERVED DATA -> INFER -> what you CANT OBSERVE (HIDDEN).**

### DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION


#### PRINCIPAL COMPONENT REGRESSION (PCR) / PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES (PLS)

[Principal component regression (PCR) Partial least squares and (PLS) ](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/11/10-statistical-techniques-data-scientists-need-master.html/2)- basically PCA and linear regression , however PLS makes use of the response variable in order to identify the new features.

 

One can describe **Principal Components Regression** as an approach for deriving a low-dimensional set of features from a large set of variables. The first principal component direction of the data is along which the observations vary the most. In other words, the first PC is a line that fits as close as possible to the data. One can fit p distinct principal components. The second PC is a linear combination of the variables that is uncorrelated with the first PC, and has the largest variance subject to this constraint. The idea is that the principal components capture the most variance in the data using linear combinations of the data in subsequently orthogonal directions. In this way, we can also combine the effects of correlated variables to get more information out of the available data, whereas in regular least squares we would have to discard one of the correlated variables.

The PCR method that we described above involves identifying linear combinations of X that best represent the predictors. These combinations (directions) are identified in an unsupervised way, since the response Y is not used to help determine the principal component directions. That is, the response Y does not supervise the identification of the principal components, thus there is no guarantee that the directions that best explain the predictors also are the best for predicting the response (even though that is often assumed). Partial least squares (PLS) are a supervised alternative to PCR. Like PCR, **PLS is a dimension reduction method, which first identifies a new smaller set of features that are linear combinations of the original features, then fits a linear model via least squares to the new M features. Yet, unlike PCR, PLS makes use of the response variable in order to identify the new features.**

Nodes are connected by using a euclidean distance.

 - basically k-means with a most center object rather than a center virtual point that was based on mean distance from all points, we keep choosing medoids samples based on minimised SSE



    *   k-medoid is a classical partitioning technique of clustering that clusters the data set of n objects into k clusters known _a priori_.
    *   It is more robust to noise and outliers as compared to [k-means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means) because it minimizes a sum of pairwise dissimilarities instead of a sum of squared Euclidean distances.
    *   A [medoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medoid) can be defined as the object of a cluster whose average dissimilarity to all the objects in the cluster is minimal. i.e. it is a most centrally located point in the cluster.
    *   Does Not scale to many samples, its O(K*n-K)^2
    *   Randomized resampling can assure efficiency and quality.

## G-means

G-means [Improves on X-means](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2526-learning-the-k-in-k-means.pdf) in the paper: The G-means algorithm starts with a small number of k-means centers, and grows the number of centers. Each iteration of the algorithm splits into two those centers whose data appear not to come from a Gaussian distribution using the **Anderson Darling test**. Between each round of splitting, we run k-means on the entire dataset and all the centers to refine the current solution. We can initialize with just k = 1, or we can choose some larger value of k if we have some prior knowledge about the range of k. G-means repeatedly makes decisions based on a statistical test for the data assigned to each enter. If the data currently assigned to a k-means center appear to be Gaussian, then we want to represent that data with only one center.

Let us briefly talk about a probabilistic generalisation of k-means: the [Gaussian Mixture Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model)(GMM).

In k-means, you carry out the following procedure:

- specify k centroids, initialising their coordinates randomly

- calculate the distance of each data point to each centroid

- assign each data point to its nearest centroid

- update the coordinates of the centroid to the mean of all points assigned to it

- iterate until convergence.

In a GMM, you carry out the following procedure:

- specify k multivariate Gaussians (termed components), initialising their mean and variance randomly

- calculate the probability of each data point being produced by each component (sometimes termed the responsibility each component takes for the data point)

- assign each data point to the component it belongs to with the highest probability

- update the mean and variance of the component to the mean and variance of all data points assigned to it

- iterate until convergence

You may notice the similarity between these two procedures. In fact, k-means is a GMM with fixed-variance components. Under a GMM, the probabilities (I think) you're looking for are the responsibilities each component takes for each data point.

## HDBSCAN*

(what is?) HDBSCAN is a clustering algorithm developed by [Campello, Moulavi, and Sander](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-37456-2_14). It extends DBSCAN by converting it into a hierarchical clustering algorithm, and then using a technique to extract a flat clustering based in the stability of clusters.



*   [Github code](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan)
*   (great) [Documentation ](http://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_hdbscan.html) with examples, for clustering, outlier detection, comparison, benchmarking and analysis!
*   ([jupytr example](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan/blob/master/notebooks/How%20HDBSCAN%20Works.ipynb)) - take a look and see how to use it, usage examples are also in the docs and github

What are the algorithmâs [steps](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/scikit-learn-contrib/hdbscan/blob/master/notebooks/How%20HDBSCAN%20Works.ipynb):



1. Transform the space according to the density/sparsity.
2. Build the minimum spanning tree of the distance weighted graph.
3. Construct a cluster hierarchy of connected components.
4. Condense the cluster hierarchy based on minimum cluster size.
5. Extract the stable clusters from the condensed tree.


## OPTICS

([What is?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm)) **Ordering points to identify the clustering structure** (**OPTICS**) is an algorithm for finding density-based<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) in spatial data



*   Its basic idea is similar to [DBSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN),<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> 
*   it addresses one of DBSCAN's major weaknesses:** the problem of detecting meaningful clusters in data of varying density. **
*   (How?) the points of the database are (linearly) ordered such that points which are spatially closest become neighbors in the ordering. 
*   a special distance is stored for each point that represents the density that needs to be accepted for a cluster in order to have both points belong to the same cluster. (This is represented as a [dendrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrogram).)


## SVM CLUSTERING

[Paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2099486/#:~:text=An%20SVM%2Dbased%20clustering%20algorithm,until%20an%20initial%20convergence%20occurs.)

An SVM-based clustering algorithm is introduced that clusters data with no a priori knowledge of input classes. 



1. The algorithm initializes by first running a binary SVM classifier against a data set with each vector in the set randomly labelled, this is repeated until an initial convergence occurs. 
2. Once this initialization step is complete, the SVM confidence parameters for classification on each of the training instances can be accessed. 
3. The lowest confidence data (e.g., the worst of the mislabelled data) then has its' labels switched to the other class label. 
4. The SVM is then re-run on the data set (with partly re-labelled data) and is guaranteed to converge in this situation since it converged previously, and now it has fewer data points to carry with mislabelling penalties. 
5. This approach appears to limit exposure to the local minima traps that can occur with other approaches. Thus, the algorithm then improves on its weakly convergent result by SVM re-training after each re-labeling on the worst of the misclassified vectors â i.e., those feature vectors with confidence factor values beyond some threshold. 
6. The repetition of the above process improves the accuracy, here a measure of separability, until there are no misclassifications. Variations on this type of clustering approach are shown.

5. [SUOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/suod) (Scalable Unsupervised Outlier Detection) is an acceleration framework for large-scale unsupervised outlier detector training and prediction. Notably, anomaly detection is often formulated as an unsupervised problem since the ground truth is expensive to acquire. To compensate for the unstable nature of unsupervised algorithms, practitioners often build a large number of models for further combination and analysis, e.g., taking the average or majority vote. However, this poses scalability challenges in high-dimensional, large datasets, especially for proximity-base models operating in Euclidean space.

    

<p id="gdcalert110" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image106.png).

![alt_text](images/image106.png "image_tooltip")



    SUOD is therefore proposed to address the challenge at three complementary levels: random projection (data level), pseudo-supervised approximation (model level), and balanced parallel scheduling (system level). As mentioned, the key focus is to accelerate the training and prediction when a large number of anomaly detectors are presented, while preserving the prediction capacity. Since its inception in Jan 2019, SUOD has been successfully used in various academic researches and industry applications, include PyOD [[2]](https://github.com/yzhao062/suod#zhao2019pyod) and [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/) medical claim analysis. It could be especially useful for outlier ensembles that rely on a large number of base estimators.

## ISOLATION FOREST

[The best resource to explain isolation forest](http://blog.easysol.net/using-isolation-forests-anamoly-detection/) - the basic idea is that for an anomaly (in the example) only 4 partitions are needed, for a regular point in the middle of a distribution, you need many many more.

[Isolation Forest](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_isolation_forest.html) -Isolating observations:



*   randomly selecting a feature 
*   randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.

Recursive partitioning can be represented by a tree structure, the number of splittings required to isolate a sample is equivalent to the path length from the root node to the terminating node.

This path length, averaged over a forest of such random trees, is a measure of normality and our decision function.

Random partitioning produces noticeable shorter paths for anomalies.

**=> when a forest of random trees collectively produce shorter path lengths for particular samples, they are highly likely to be anomalies.**

 [the paper is pretty good too - ](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/zhouzh.files/publication/icdm08b.pdf) In the training stage, iTrees are constructed by recursively partitioning the given training set until instances are isolated or a specific tree height is reached of which results a partial model. 

Note that the tree height limit l is automatically set by the sub-sampling size Ï: l = ceiling(log2 Ï), which is approximately the average tree height [7]. 

**The rationale of growing trees up to the average tree height is that we are only interested in data points that have shorter-than average path lengths, as those points are more likely to be anomalies**




## LOCAL OUTLIER FACTOR



*   [LOF ](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html#local-outlier-factor)computes a score (called local outlier factor) reflecting the degree of abnormality of the observations.
*   **It measures the local density deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. The idea is to detect the samples that have a substantially lower density than their neighbors.**
*   In practice the local density is obtained from the **k-nearest neighbors. **
*   The LOF score of an observation is equal to the ratio of the average local density of his k-nearest neighbors, and its own local density: 
    *   **a normal instance is expected to have a local density** similar to that of its neighbors, 
    *   **while abnormal data are expected to have much smaller local density.**


## ELLIPTIC ENVELOPE



1. We  assume that the **regular data come from a known distribution** (e.g. data are Gaussian distributed). 
2. From this assumption, we generally try to **define the âshapeâ of the data**, 
3. And can define **outlying observations as observations which stand far** enough from the fit shape.




## ONE CLASS SVM

The volume of this hypersphere is minimized, to minimize the effect of incorporating outliers in the solution.

    The resulting hypersphere is characterized by a center and a radius R>0 as distance from the center to (any support vector on) the boundary, of which the volume R2 will be minimized.

*   For classification the Gini cost function is used which provides an indication of how âpureâ the leaf nodes are (how mixed the training data assigned to each node is).

Gini = sum(pk * (1 â pk))



*   Early stop - 1 sample per node is overfitting, 5-10 are good
*   Pruning - evaluate what happens if the lead nodes are removed, if there is a big drop, we need it.

## SEQUENTIAL MINIMAL OPTIMIZATION (SMO)

**- [What is the SMO (SVM) classifier?](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/sequential-minimal-optimization-a-fast-algorithm-for-training-support-vector-machines/?from=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fpubs%2F69644%2Ftr-98-14.pdf)** - Sequential Minimal Optimization , or SMO . Training a support vector machine requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this large QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because matrix computation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while the standard chunking SVM algorithm scales somewhere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMOâs computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. On real- world sparse data sets, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the chunking algorithm.

## SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (SVM)

**- [Definition](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/ml/doc/support_vector_machines.html), [tutorial](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.07-support-vector-machines.html)***:** 



*   For Optimal **2-class classifier**. 
*   Extended for **regression **and **clustering problems (1 class).** 
*   **Kernel-based**
    *   **maps** feature vectors into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel** **function 
    *   **builds** an **optimal linear discriminating function** in this space (linear?) or an **optimal hyper-plane** (RBF?) that fits the training data 
*   In case of SVM, the **kernel is not defined explicitly**. 
*   **A distance needs** **to be defined** between any 2 points in the hyper-space.
*   The solution is optimal, **the margin** **is maximal. **between the separating hyper-plane and the nearest feature vectors 
*   **The feature vectors that are the closest to the hyper-plane are called support vectors, which means that the position of other vectors does not affect the hyper-plane (the decision function). **
*   The model produced by support vector classification (as described above) depends only on a **subset of the training data**, because the cost function for building the model does not care about training points that lie beyond the margin.

**Math of SVM on youtube:**



*   [very good number-based example #1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NxnPkZM9bc)
*   [Very good but lengthy and chatty example with make-sense math #2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU_N3nmv0Go&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPlkESDcHD-0oqVx5sAIgz7O&index=4) - udacity
    *   Linear - maximize the margin, optimal solution, only a few close points are really needed the others are zeroes by the alphas (alpha says âpay attention to this variableâ) in the quadratic programming equation. XtX is a similarity function (pairs of points that relate to each other in output labels and how similar to one another, Xiâs point in the same direction) y1y2 are the labels. Therefore further points are not needed. But the similarity is important here(?)
    *   Non-linear - e.g. circle inside a circle, needs to map to a higher plane, a measure of similarity as XtX is important. We use this similarity idea to map into a higher plane, but we choose the higher plane for the purpose of a final function that behaves likes a known function, such as (A+B)^2. It turns out that (q1,q2,root(2)q1q2) is engineered with that root(2) thing for the purpose of making the multiplication of X^tY, which turns out to be (X^tY)^2. We can substitute this formula (X^tY)^2 instead of the X^tX in the quadratic equation to do that for us.This is the kernel trick that maps the inner class to one side and the outer circle class to the other and passes a plane in between them. 
    *   Similarity is defined intuitively as all the points in one class vs the other.. I think
    *   A general kernel K=(X^tY + C)^p is a polynomial kernel that can define the above function and others.
    *   Quadratic eq with possible kernels including the polynomial.

## SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION (SVR)

 - [Definition Support Vector Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm-implementation-details).:



*   The method of SVM can be extended to solve regression problems. 
*   Similar to SVM, the model produced by Support Vector Regression depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data close to the model prediction.


## [LibSVM vs LibLinear](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11508788/whats-the-difference-between-libsvm-and-liblinear) 

- using many kernel transforms to turn a non-linear problem into a linear problem beforehand.

From the link above, it seems like liblinear is very much the same thing, without those kernel transforms. So, as they say, in cases where the kernel transforms are not needed (they mention document classification), it will be faster. 



*    libsvm (SMO) implementation 
    *   kernel (n^2) 
    *   Linear SVM (n^3) 
*   liblinear - optimized to deal with linear classification without kernels
    *   Complexity O(n) 
    *   does not support kernel SVMs. 
    *   Scores higher

**n** is the number of samples in the training dataset.

**Conclusion**: In practice libsvm becomes painfully slow at 10k samples. Hence for medium to large scale datasets use liblinear and forget about libsvm (or maybe have a look at approximate kernel SVM solvers such as [LaSVM](http://leon.bottou.org/projects/lasvm), which saves training time and memory usage for large scale datasets).


## Support vector clustering (SVC)

[paper](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume2/horn01a/horn01a.pdf), [short explanation](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-SVMs-for-unsupervised-learning-density-estimation)


## KERNELS

[What are kernels in SVM](https://www.quora.com/What-are-Kernels-in-Machine-Learning-and-SVM)** **-** **intuition and example



*   allows us to do certain calculations faster which otherwise would involve computations in higher dimensional space.
*   K(x, y) = &lt;f(x), f(y)>. Here K is the kernel function, x, y are n dimensional inputs. f is a map from n-dimension to m-dimension space. &lt; x,y> denotes the dot product. usually m is much larger than n.
*   normally calculating &lt;f(x), f(y)> requires us to calculate f(x), f(y) first, and then do the dot product. These two computation steps can be quite expensive as they involve manipulations in m dimensional space, where m can be a large number.
*   Result is ONLY a scalar, i..e., 1-dim space.
*   We **donât **need to do that calc if we use a clever kernel.

Example:

Simple Example: x = (x1, x2, x3); y = (y1, y2, y3). Then for the function f(x) = (x1x1, x1x2, x1x3, x2x1, x2x2, x2x3, x3x1, x3x2, x3x3), the kernel is K(x, y ) = (&lt;x, y>)^2.

Let's plug in some numbers to make this more intuitive: suppose x = (1, 2, 3); y = (4, 5, 6). Then:

f(x) = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9)  and f(y) = (16, 20, 24, 20, 25, 30, 24, 30, 36)

&lt;f(x), f(y)> = 16 + 40 + 72 + 40 + 100+ 180 + 72 + 180 + 324 = 1024 i.e., 1*16+2*20+*3*24..

A lot of algebra. Mainly because f is a mapping from 3-dimensional to 9 dimensional space.

With a kernel its faster.

K(x, y) = (4 + 10 + 18 ) ^2 = 32^2 = 1024

**A kernel is a magical shortcut to calculate even infinite dimensions!**

**[Relation to SVM](https://www.quora.com/What-are-Kernels-in-Machine-Learning-and-SVM)?**: 



*   The idea of SVM is that y = w phi(x) +b, where w is the weight, phi is the feature vector, and b is the bias. 
*   if y> 0, then we classify datum to class 1, else to class 0. 
*   We want to find a set of weight and bias such that the margin is maximized.
*   Previous answers mention that kernel makes data linearly separable for SVM. I think a more precise way to put this is, **kernels do not make the the data linearly separable**. 
*   The feature vector **phi(x) makes the data linearly separable**. **Kernel is to make the calculation process faster and easier**, especially when the feature vector **phi is of very high dimension (for example, x1, x2, x3, ..., x_D^n, x1^2, x2^2, ...., x_D^2).**
*   Why it can also be understood as a measure of similarity:  if we put the definition of kernel above, **&lt;f(x), f(y)>**, in the context of SVM and feature vectors, it becomes **&lt;phi(x), phi(y)>. The inner product means the projection of phi(x) onto phi(y**). **or colloquially, how much overlap do x and y have in their feature space. In other words, how similar they are.**

**[Kernels](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/modules/ml/doc/support_vector_machines.html):**



*   **SVM::LINEAR Linear kernel. No mapping is done, linear discrimination (or regression) is done in the original feature space. It is the fastest option. **

## [Ensembles in WEKA](http://machinelearningmastery.com/use-ensemble-machine-learning-algorithms-weka/) 

- bagging (random sample selection, multi classifier training), random forest (random feature selection for each tree, multi tree training), boosting(creating stumps, each new stump tries to fix the previous error, at last combining results using new data, each model is assigned a skill weight and accounted for in the end), voting(majority vote, any set of algorithms within weka, results combined via mean or some other way), stacking(same as voting but combining predictions using a meta model is used).




## BAGGING - bootstrap aggregating

[Bagging ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mg8QD0F1dQ&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPnIRwl6rad_mYwEk4Gmj7Mx&index=192)- best example so far, create m bags, put nâ&lt;n samples (60% of n) in each bag - with replacement which means that the same sample can be selected twice or more, query from the test (x) each of the m models, calculate mean, this is the classification.

**Overfitting - ** not an issue with bagging, as the mean of the models actually averages or **smoothes** the âcurvesâ. Even if all of them are overfitted.

Adaboost: similar to bagging, create a system that chooses from samples that were modelled poorly before.



1. create bag_1 with nâ features &lt;n with replacement, create the model_1, test on ALL train.
2. Create bag_2 with nâ features with replacement, but add a bias for selecting from the samples that were wrongly classified by the model_1. Create a model_2. Average results from model_1 and model_2. I.e., who was classified correctly or not.
3. Create bag_3 with nâ features with replacement, but add a bias for selecting from the samples that were wrongly classified by the model_1+2. Create a model_3. Average results from model_1, 2 & 3 I.e., who was classified correctly or not. Iterate onward.
4. Create bag_m with nâ features with replacement, but add a bias for selecting from the samples that were wrongly classified by the previous steps.

        There are two things we are trying to accomplish with whitening:

1. Make the features less correlated with one another.
2. Give all of the features the same variance.

        Whitening has two simple steps:

1. Project the dataset onto the eigenvectors. This rotates the dataset so that there is no correlation between the components.
2. Normalize the the dataset to have a variance of 1 for all components. This is done by simply dividing each component by the square root of its eigenvalue.

## LDA - Linear discriminant analysis

[A comprehensive tutorial on LDA - read!](https://iksinc.online/2018/11/12/dimensionality-reduction-via-linear-discriminant-analysis/?fbclid=IwAR3d0ja_HP0DkamiL3W4QxzjcsIfoySB_G7LetTNf0cE0ed_MVduXfi6bv0)

[Dim reduction with LDA - nice examples](https://iksinc.online/2018/11/12/dimensionality-reduction-via-linear-discriminant-analysis/?fbclid=IwAR3d0ja_HP0DkamiL3W4QxzjcsIfoySB_G7LetTNf0cE0ed_MVduXfi6bv0)

([Not to be confused with the other LDA](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_lda.html)) - **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** is most commonly used as dimensionality reduction technique in the pre-processing step for pattern-classification and machine learning applications. **The goal is to project a dataset onto a lower-dimensional space with good class-separability in order avoid overfitting** (âcurse of dimensionalityâ) **and also reduce computational costs**.

PCA vs LDA:

Both Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are **linear transformation techniques used for dimensionality reduction**. 



*   PCA can be described as an â**unsupervised**â algorithm, since it âignoresâ class labels and its goal is to find the directions (the so-called principal components) that maximize the variance in a dataset.
*   In contrast to PCA, **LDA is âsupervised**â and computes the directions (âlinear discriminantsâ) that will represent the axes that maximize the separation between multiple classes.

Although it might sound intuitive that LDA is superior to PCA for a multi-class classification task where the class labels are known, this might not always the case.

For example, comparisons between classification accuracies for image recognition after using PCA or LDA show that :



*   **PCA tends to outperform LDA if the number of samples per class is relatively small** ([PCA vs. LDA](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=908974), A.M. Martinez et al., 2001). 
*   **In practice, it is also not uncommon to use both LDA and PCA in combination**: 

**Best Practice**: **PCA for dimensionality reduction can be followed by an LDA.** But before we skip to the results of the respective linear transformations, let us quickly recapitulate the purposes of PCA and LDA: PCA finds the axes with maximum variance for the whole data set where LDA tries to find the axes for best class separability. **In practice, often a LDA is done followed by a PCA for dimensionality reduction.**

[LSA ](http://mccormickml.com/2016/03/25/lsa-for-text-classification-tutorial/)is quite simple, you just use SVD to perform dimensionality reduction on the tf-idf vectorsâthatâs really all there is to it! And [LSA CLUSTERING](http://mccormickml.com/2015/08/05/document-clustering-example-in-scikit-learn/)

Here is a very nice [tutorial about LSA,](https://technowiki.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/latent-semantic-analysis-lsa-tutorial/) with code, explaining what are the three matrices, word clustering, sentence clustering and vector importance. They say that for sentence space we need to remove the first vector as it is correlated with sentence length.

**PCA vs LSA**: ([intuition1](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/65699/lsa-vs-pca-document-clustering), [intuition2](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3869/what-is-the-intuitive-relationship-between-svd-and-pca))



*   reduction of the dimensionality
*   noise reduction
*   incorporating relations between terms into the representation. 
*   SVD and PCA and "total least-squares" (and several other names) are the same thing. It computes the orthogonal transform that decorrelates the variables and keeps the ones with the largest variance. There are two numerical approaches: one by SVD of the (centered) data matrix, and one by Eigen decomposition of this matrix "squared" (covariance).

## ICA



1. While PCA is global, it finds global variables (with images we get eigen faces, good for reconstruction) that maximizes variance in orthogonal directions, and is not influenced by the TRANSPOSE of the data matrix.
2. On the other hand, ICA is local and finds local variables (with images we get eyes ears, mouth, basically edges!, etc), ICA will result differently on TRANSPOSED matrices, unlike PCA, its also âdirectionalâ - consider the âcocktail partyâ problem. On documents, ICA gives topics.
3. It helps, similarly to PCA, to help us analyze our data.

# GENETIC ALGORITHMS / PROGRAMMING

[What is the difference?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3819977/what-are-the-differences-between-genetic-algorithms-and-genetic-programming) Genetic programming and genetic algorithms are very similar. They are both used to evolve the answer to a problem, by comparing the fitness of each candidate in a population of potential candidates over many generations.

Each generation, new candidates are found by randomly changing (mutation) or swapping parts (crossover) of other candidates. The least 'fit' candidates are removed from the population. - peterjwest

**Genetic algorithms** (GA) are search algorithms that mimic the process of natural evolution, where each individual is a candidate solution: individuals are generally "raw data" (in whatever encoding format has been defined).

**Genetic programming** (GP) is considered a special case of GA, where _each individual is a computer program_ (not just "raw data"). GP explore the _algorithmic search space_ and _evolve computer programs_ to perform a defined task.

**Selection of KPI**: In our experiments, we use failure rate as the KPI for problem identification. **failure rate** is an important KPI for evaluating system service availability. There are also other KPIs such as mean time between failures, average request latency, throughput, etc. In our future work, we will experiment with problem identification concerning different KPI metrics. **Noises in labeling**: Our experiments are based on three datasets that are collected as a period of logs on three different days. The engineers manually inspected and labeled the log sequences. (false positives/negatives) may be introduced during the manual labeling process. However, as the engineers are experienced professionals of the product team who maintain the service system, we believe the amount of noise is small (if it exists)

    Furthermore, we compare our method with two typical methods: PCA [41] and Invariants Mining [23]. All these three methods are unsupervised, log-based problem identification methods. PCA projects the log sequence vectors into a subspace. If the projected vector is far from the majority, it is considered as a problem. Invariants Mining extracts the linear relations (invariants) between log event occurrences, which hypothesizes that log events are often pairwise generated. For example, when processing files, "File A is opened" and "File A is closed" should be printed as a pair. Log sequences that violate the invariants are regarded as problematic. Log3C achieves good recalls (similar to those achieved by two comparative methods) and surpasses the comparative methods concerning precision and F1-measure.

Meanwhile, the design of logzip is highly parallel and only incurs negligible overhead. In addition, we share our industrial experience of applying logzip to Huawei's real products.**

*   Feature extraction using fixed window, sliding window and session window
    *   **Fixed window**: Both fixed windows and sliding windows are based on timestamp, which records the occurrence time of each log. Each fixed window has its size, which means the time span or time duration. As shown in Figure 1, the window size is Ît, which is a constant value, such as one hour or one day. Thus, the number of fixed windows depends on the predefined window size. Logs that happened in the same window are regarded as a log sequence. 
    *   **Sliding window**: Different from fixed windows, sliding windows consist of two attributes: window size and step size, e.g., hourly windows sliding every five minutes. In general, step size is smaller than window size, therefore causing the overlap of different windows. Figure 1 shows that the window size is ÎT , while the step size is the forwarding distance. The number of sliding windows, which is often larger than fixed windows, mainly depends on both window size and step size. Logs that occurred in the same sliding window are also grouped as a log sequence, though logs may duplicate in multiple sliding windows due to the overlap. 
    *   **Session** **window**: Compared with the above two windowing types, session windows are based on identifiers instead of the timestamp. Identifiers are utilized to mark different execution paths in some log data. For instance, HDFS logs with block_id record the allocation, writing, replication, deletion of certain block. Thus, we can group logs according to the identifiers, where each session window has a unique identifier

*   PCA was first applied in log-based anomaly detection by Xu et al. [47]. In their anomaly detection method, each log sequence is vectorized as an event count vector. After that, PCA is employed to find patterns between the dimensions of event count vectors. Employing PCA, two subspace are generated, namely normal space Sn and anomaly space Sa. Sn is constructed by the first k principal components and Sn is constructed by the remaining (nâk), where n is the original dimension. Then, the projection ya = (1âP P T )y of an event count vector y to Sa is calculated, where P = [v1,v2, ...,vk,] is the first k principal components. If the length of ya is larger

1. **Accuracy** measures the ability of a log parser in distinguishing constant parts and variable parts. Accuracy is one main focus of existing log parsing studies because an inaccurate log parser could greatly limit the effectiveness of the downstream log mining tasks [9].  \
** \
Supervised Accuracy Metric: PA metric is the ratio of correctly parsed log messages over the total number of log messages: \
**
*   For fairness of comparison, we apply the same preprocessing rules (e.g., IP or number replacement) to each log parser. 
*   After parsing, each log message has an event template, which in turn corresponds to a group of messages of the same template.  \

*   A log message is considered correctly parsed if and only if its event template corresponds to the same group of log messages as the ground truth does. For example, if a log sequence [E1, E2, E2] is parsed to [E1, E4, E5], we get PA=1/3, since the 2nd and 3rd messages are not grouped together. \

*   In contrast to standard evaluation metrics that are used in previous studies, such as precision, recall, and F1-measure **[9], [22], [28],** PA is a more rigorous metric. I**n PA, partially matched events are considered incorrect.** 
*   The parameters of all the log parsers are fine-tuned through over 10 runs and the best results are reported to avoid bias from randomization. ** \

2. **Robustness** of a log parser measures the consistency of its accuracy under log datasets of different sizes or from different systems. A robust log parser should perform consistently across different datasets, and thus can be used in the versatile production environment.  \
 \
Robustness is crucial to the practical use of a log parser in production environments. In this part, we evaluate the robustness of log parsers from two aspects: 1) robustness across different types of logs and 2) robustness on different volumes of logs. \

3. **Efficiency** measures the processing speed of a log parser. We evaluate the efficiency by recording the time that a parser takes to parse a specific dataset. The less time a log parser consumes, the higher efficiency it provides. \
 \
Efficiency is an important aspect of log parsers to consider in order to handle log data in large scale. To measure the efficiency of a log parser, we record the running time it needs to finish the entire parsing process. Similar to the setting of the previous experiment, we evaluate six log parsers on three log datasets.

[9] - [An Evaluation Study on Log Parsing and Its Use in Log Mining](http://jmzhu.logpai.com/pub/pjhe_dsn2016.pdf)

a commonly used evaluation metric for clustering algorithms, to evaluate the parsing accuracy of log parsing methods. To calculate Fmeasure, we manually obtain the ground truths for all logs of these dataset. It is possible because we iteratively filter out logs with confirmed event using regular expression. Experiments about LKE and LogSig are run 10 times to avoid bias of clustering algorithms, while others are run once because they are deterministic. We note here that only the parts of free-text log message contents are used in evaluating the log parsing methods

. These cluster descriptions then became our gold standard, against which to measure the performance of the other algorithms as an information retrieval (IR) task. As in classic IR, our performance metrics are Recall, Precision and F-Measure, which are described in [**17**]. The True Positive(TP), False Positive(FP) and False Negative(FN) values were derived by comparing the set of manually produced line formats to the set of retrieved formats produced by each algorithm. In our evaluation a line format is still considered a FP even if matches a manually produced line format to some degree, the match has to be exact for it to be considered a TP. The next section gives more details about the results of our experiments.

This section introduces four external criteria of clustering quality. **_Purity_** is a simple and transparent evaluation measure. **_Normalized mutual information_** can be information-theoretically interpreted. The **_Rand index_** penalizes both false positive and false negative decisions during clustering. The **_F measure_** in addition supports differential weighting of these two types of errors.

**High purity is easy to achieve when the number of clusters is large** - in particular, purity is 1 if each document gets its own cluster. Thus, we cannot use purity to trade off the quality of the clustering against the number of clusters.

MI has the same problem as purity: it does not penalize large cardinalities and thus does not formalize our bias that, other things being equal, fewer clusters are better. 

Because NMI is normalized, we can use it to compare clusterings with different numbers of clusters.

The Rand index gives equal weight to false positives and false negatives. Separating similar documents is sometimes worse than putting pairs of dissimilar documents in the same cluster.

[Time series patterns:  ](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/1)



*   A **trend (a,b,c) **exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. 
*   A **seasonal (a - big waves) **pattern occurs when a time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week. The monthly sales induced by the change in cost at the end of the calendar year.
*   A **cycle (a) **occurs when the data exhibit rises and falls that are not of a fixed period - **sometimes years.**

[Some statistical measures](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/2) (mean, median, percentiles, iqr, std dev, bivariate statistics - correlation between variables)

 

**Bivariate Formula**: this correlation measures the **extent of a linear relationship between two variables**. high number = high correlation between two variable. The value of **r** always lies between -1 and 1 with negative values indicating a negative relationship and positive values indicating a positive relationship. Negative = decreasing, positive = increasing.

## [Forecasting methods](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/2/3)



*   **Average**: Forecasts of all future values are equal to the mean of the historical data.
*   **Naive**: Forecasts are simply set to be the value of the last observation.
*   **Seasonal Naive**: forecast to be equal to the last observed value from the same season of the year 
*   **Drift: **A variation on the naÃ¯ve method is to allow the forecasts to increase or decrease over time, the drift is set to be the average change seen in the historical data.

*   **Dummy variables: **sunday, monday, tues,wed,thurs, friday.** NO SATURDAY!**
*   notice that only six dummy variables are needed to code seven categories. That is because the seventh category (in this case Sunday) is specified when the dummy variables are all set to zero. Many beginners will try to add a seventh dummy variable for the seventh category. This is known as the "dummy variable trap" because it will cause the regression to fail.
*   **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Outliers: If there is an outlier in the data, rather than omit it, you     can use a dummy variable to remove its effect. In this case, the dummy variable takes value one for that observation and zero everywhere else.</span>**
*   **Public holidays: **For daily data, the effect of public holidays can be accounted for by including a dummy variable predictor taking value one on public holidays and zero elsewhere.
*   **Easter:** is different from most holidays because it is not held on the same date each year and the effect can last for several days. In this case, a dummy variable can be used with value one where any part of the holiday falls in the particular time period and zero otherwise.
*   **Trading days: **The number of trading days in a month can vary considerably and can have a substantial effect on sales data. To allow for this, the number of trading days in each month can be included as a predictor.

## [Rolling window analysis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-0-387-32348-0_9)

 âcompute parameter estimates over a rolling window of a fixed size through the sample. If the parameters are truly constant over the entire sample, then the estimates over the rolling windows should not be too different. If the parameters change at some point during the sample, then the rolling estimates should capture this instabilityâ


## [Moving average window](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/2)

 estimate the trend cycle



*   3-5-7-9? If its too large its going to flatten the curve, too low its going to be similar to the actual curve.
*   two tier moving average, first 4 then 2 on the resulted moving average.

1. Level. The baseline value for the series if it were a straight line.
2. Trend. The optional and often linear increasing or decreasing behavior of the series over time.
3. Seasonality. The optional repeating patterns or cycles of behavior over time.
4. Noise. The optional variability in the observations that cannot be explained by the model.

**All time series have a level, most have noise, and the trend and seasonality are optional.**

*   linear/nonlinear classifiers: predict a single output value - using the t-1 previous line, i.e., **âmeasure1 t, measure 2 t, measure 1 t+1, measure 2 t+1 (as the class)â **
*   Neural networks: predict multiple output values, i.e., **âmeasure1 t, measure 2 t, measure 1 t+1(class1), measure 2 t+1(class2)â **

**One-Step Forecast: **This is where the next time step (t+1) is predicted.

**Multi-Step Forecast: **This is where two or more future time steps are to be predicted.

Multi-step forecast using a window of â1â and a typical sample âtime, measure1â, i.e., using the current value input we label it as the two future input labels: 



*   **âmeasure1 t, measure1 t+1(class) , measure1 t+2(class1)â **

    [Nicholas Christakis](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/christakis/) of Harvard and [James Fowler](http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/) of UC San Diego have produced a series of ground-breaking papers analyzing the spread of various traits in social networks: [obesity](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/4/370), [smoking](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/21/2249), [happiness](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/dec04_2/a2338), and most recently, in collaboration with John Cacioppo, [loneliness](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1319108). The Christakis-Fowler collaboration has now become [well-known](http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/science_friendship_as_a_health_factor.pdf), but from a technical perspective, what was special about their work?


    It turns out that they found a way to distinguish between the three reasons why people who are related in a social network are similar to each other.

1. Homophily is the tendency of people to seek others who are alike. For example, most of us restrict our dates to smokers or non-smokers, mirroring our own behavior.
2. Confounding is the phenomenon of related individuals developing a trait because of a (shared) environmental circumstance. For example, people living right next to a McDonaldâs might all gradually become obese.
3. Induction is the process of one individual passing a trait or behavior on to their friends, whether by active encouragement or by setting an example
6. [Networkx ](https://networkx.org/documentation//networkx-1.10/reference/algorithms.html)- Centrality is just a fraction of the algorithms contained in networkx.

# (DEEP) NEURAL NETS



*   [Deep learning notes from Andrew NGâs course.](https://www.slideshare.net/TessFerrandez/notes-from-coursera-deep-learning-courses-by-andrew-ng)
*   

    Jay Alammar on NN[ Part 1](http://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/),[ Part 2](http://jalammar.github.io/feedforward-neural-networks-visual-interactive/)

*   **[NN in general](http://briandolhansky.com/blog/?tag=neural+network#show-archive) - 5 introductions  tutorials.**
*   **[Segmentation examples](https://meetshah1995.github.io/semantic-segmentation/deep-learning/pytorch/visdom/2017/06/01/semantic-segmentation-over-the-years.html)**

    MLP: fully connected, input, hidden layers, output. Gradient on the backprop takes a lot of time to calculate. Has vanishing gradient problem, because of multiplications when it reaches the first layers the loss correction is very small (0.1*0.1*01 = 0.001), therefore the early layers train slower than the last ones, and the early ones capture the basics structures so they are the more important ones.


    AutoEncoder - unsupervised, drives the input through fully connected layers, sometime reducing their neurons amount, then does the reverse and expands the layerâs size to get to the input (images are multiplied by the transpose matrix, many times over), Comparing the predicted output to the input, correcting the cost using gradient descent and redoing it, until the networks learns the output. 

*   Convolutional auto encoder
*   Denoiser auto encoder - masking areas in order to create an encoder that understands noisy images
*   Variational autoencoder - doesnt rely on distance between pixels, rather it maps them to a function (gaussian), eventually the DS should be explained by this mapping, uses 2 new layers added to the network. Gaussian will create blurry images, but similar. Please note that it also works with CNN.

    What are [logits ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41455101/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-logits-in-tensorflow)in neural net - the vector of raw (non-normalized) predictions that a classification model generates, which is ordinarily then passed to a normalization function. If the model is solving a multi-class classification problem, logits typically become an input to the softmax function. The softmax function then generates a vector of (normalized) probabilities with one value for each possible class.

    DBN - deep belief networks, similar structure to multi layer perceptron. fully connected, input, hidden(s), output layers. Can be thought of as stacks of RBM. training using GPU optimization, accurate and needs smaller labelled data set to complete the training.


    Solves the âvanishing gradientâ problem, imagine a fully connected network, advancing each 2 layers step by step until each boltzman network (2 layers) learns the output, keeps advancing until finished.. Each layer learns the entire input. 


    Next step is to fine tune using a labelled test set, improves performance and alters the net. So basically using labeled samples we fine tune and associate features and pattern with a name. Weights and biases are altered slightly and there is also an increase in performance. Unlike CNN which learns features then high level features.


    Accurate and reasonable in time, unlike fully connected that has the vanishing gradient problem.


    **Transfer Learning **= like Inception in Tensor flow, use a prebuilt network to solve many problems that âworkâ similarly to the original network.

    *    Feature extraction from the CNN part (removing the fully connected layer)
    *   Fine-tuning, everything or partial selection of the hidden layers, mainly good to keep low level neurons that know what edges and color blobs are, but not dog breeds or something not as general.

## GRADIENT DESCENT

(**[What are](http://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-mini-batch-gradient-descent-configure-batch-size/)?**) batch, stochastic, and mini-batch gradient descent are and the benefits and limitations of each method.

[What is gradient descent, how to use it, local minima okay to use, compared to global. Saddle points, learning rate strategies and research points](https://blog.paperspace.com/intro-to-optimization-in-deep-learning-gradient-descent/)



1. Gradient descent is an **optimization algorithm **often used for finding the weights or coefficients of machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and logistic regression.
2. the model makes predictions on training data, then **use the error on the predictions to update the model to reduce the error.**
3. The goal of the algorithm is to find model parameters (e.g. coefficients or weights) that **minimize the error of the model on the training dataset**. It does this by making changes to the model that move it along a gradient or slope of errors down toward a minimum error value. This gives the algorithm its name of âgradient descent.â


### Stochastic 



*   calculate error and updates the model **after every training sample**


### Batch 



*   calculates the error for each example in the training dataset, but only updates the model **after all training examples have been evaluated.**


### Mini batch (most common) 



*   splits the training dataset into small batches, used to calculate model error and update model coefficients. 
*   Implementations may choose to sum the gradient over the mini-batch or take the average of the gradient (reduces variance of gradient) **(unclear?)**

## Batch size

([a good read)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-different-batch-sizes-training-predicting-python-keras/) about batch sizes in keras, specifically LSTM, read this first! 

A sequence prediction problem makes a good case for a varied batch size as you may want to have a batch size equal to the training dataset size (batch learning) during training and a batch size of 1 when making predictions for one-step outputs.

**power of 2:** have some advantages with regards to vectorized operations in certain packages, so if it's close it might be faster to keep your batch_size in a power of 2.

([pushing batches of samples to memory in order to train)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/153531/what-is-batch-size-in-neural-network) - 

Batch size defines number of samples that going to be propagated through the network.

For instance, let's say you have 1050 training samples and you want to set up batch_size equal to 100. Algorithm takes first 100 samples (from 1st to 100th) from the training dataset and trains network. Next it takes second 100 samples (from 101st to 200th) and train network again. We can keep doing this procedure until we will propagate through the networks all samples. The problem usually happens with the last set of samples. In our example we've used 1050 which is not divisible by 100 without remainder. The simplest solution is just to get final 50 samples and train the network.

**Advantages**:



*   It requires less memory. Since you train network using less number of samples the overall training procedure requires less memory. It's especially important in case if you are not able to fit dataset in memory.
*   Typically networks trains faster with mini-batches. That's because we update weights after each propagation. In our example we've propagated 11 batches (10 of them had 100 samples and 1 had 50 samples) and after each of them we've updated network's parameters. If we used all samples during propagation we would make only 1 update for the network's parameter.

**Disadvantages**:



*   **The smaller the batch the less accurate estimate of the gradient.** In the figure below you can see that mini-batch (green color) gradient's direction **fluctuates **compare to the full batch (blue color).

[Another observation, probably empirical](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35050753/how-big-should-batch-size-and-number-of-epochs-be-when-fitting-a-model-in-keras) -  **to answer your questions on Batch Size and Epochs:**

_In general_: Larger batch sizes result in faster progress in training, but don't always converge as fast. Smaller batch sizes train slower, but _can_ converge faster. It's definitely problem dependent.

_In general_, the models improve with more epochs of training, to a point. They'll start to plateau in accuracy as they converge. Try something like 50 and plot number of epochs (x axis) vs. accuracy (y axis). You'll see where it levels out.

## BATCH NORMALIZATION



1. The [best explanation](https://blog.paperspace.com/busting-the-myths-about-batch-normalization/) to what is BN and why to use it, including busting the myth that it solves internal covariance shift - shifting input distribution, and saying that it should come after activations as it makes more sense (it does),also a nice quote on where a layer ends is really good - it can end at the activation (or not). How to use BN in the test, hint: use a moving window. Bn allows us to use 2 parameters to control the input distribution instead of controlling all the weights.

[What is the diff between batch/layer/recurrent batch and back rnn normalization](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/12956/paper-whats-the-difference-between-layer-normalization-recurrent-batch-normal)



*   Layer normalization (Ba 2016): Does not use batch statistics. Normalize using the statistics collected from all units within a layer of the current sample. Does not work well with ConvNets.
*   Recurrent Batch Normalization (BN) (Cooijmans, 2016; also proposed concurrently by Qianli Liao & Tomaso Poggio, but tested on Recurrent ConvNets, instead of RNN/LSTM): Same as batch normalization. Use different normalization statistics for each time step. You need to store a set of mean and standard deviation for each time step.
*   Batch Normalized Recurrent Neural Networks (Laurent, 2015): batch normalization is only applied between the input and hidden state, but not between hidden states. i.e., normalization is not applied over time.
*   Streaming Normalization (Liao et al. 2016) : it summarizes existing normalizations and overcomes most issues mentioned above. It works well with ConvNets, recurrent learning and online learning (i.e., small mini-batch or one sample at a time):
*   Weight Normalization (Salimans and Kingma 2016): whenever a weight is used, it is divided by its L2 norm first, such that the resulting weight has L2 norm 1. That is, output y=xâ(w/|w|), where x and w denote the input and weight respectively. A scalar scaling factor g is then multiplied to the output y=yâg. But in my experience g seems not essential for performance (also downstream learnable layers can learn this anyway).
*   Cosine Normalization (Luo et al. 2017): weight normalization is very similar to cosine normalization, where the same L2 normalization is applied to both weight and input: y=(x/|x|)â(w/|w|). Again, manual or automatic differentiation can compute appropriate gradients of x and w.
*   Note that both Weight and Cosine Normalization have been extensively used (called normalized dot product) in the 2000s in a class of ConvNets called HMAX (Riesenhuber 1999) to model biological vision. You may find them interesting.

1. Layer normalization solves the rnn case that batch couldnt - Is done per feature within the layer and normalized features are replaced
2. Instance does it for (cnn?) using per channel normalization
3. Group does it for group of channels

## LOSS

**[Very Basic advice](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/232754/reference-to-learn-how-to-interpret-learning-curves-of-deep-convolutional-neural):** You should probably switch train/validation repartition to something like 80% training and 20% validation. In most cases it will improve the classifier performance overall (more training data = better performance)

+If Training error and test error are too close (your system is unable to overfit on your training data), this means that your model is too simple. Solution: more layers or more neurons per layer.


#### 


#### Early stopping

If you have never heard about "early-stopping" you should look it up, it's an important concept in the neural network domain : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping) . To summarize, the idea behind early-stopping is to stop the training once the validation loss starts plateauing. Indeed, when this happens it almost always mean you are starting to overfitt your classifier. The training loss value in itself is not something you should trust, beacause it will continue to increase event when you are overfitting your classifier.

With [cross entropy](https://www.quora.com/Loss-cross-entropy-is-decreasing-but-accuracy-remains-the-same-while-training-convolutional-neural-networks-How-can-it-happen) there can be an issue where the accuracy is the same for two cases, one where the loss is decreasing and the other when the loss is not changing much.

This indicates that the model is overfitting. It continues to get better and better at fitting the data that it sees (training data) while getting worse and worse at fitting the data that it does not see (validation data).

Adaptive gradient descent algorithms such as [Adagrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#AdaGrad), **Adadelta**, [RMSprop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#RMSProp), [Adam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam), provide an alternative to classical **SGD**. 

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">These per-parameter learning rate methods provide **heuristic approach without requiring expensive work in** **tuning hyperparameters for the learning rate schedule manually.**</span>

 



1. **Adagrad **performs larger updates for more sparse parameters and smaller updates for less sparse parameter. It has good performance with sparse data and training large-scale neural network.

2. **Adadelta **is an extension of Adagrad that seeks to **reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.**
3. **RMSprop **adjusts the Adagrad method in a very **simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate**. 
4. **[Adam ](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/)**is an update to the RMSProp optimizer which is like **RMSprop with momentum**.

Another great comparison - [pdf paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747) and [webpage link](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) - 



*   if your input data is sparse, then you likely achieve the best results using one of the adaptive learning-rate methods. 
*   An additional benefit is that you will not need to tune the learning rate but will likely achieve the best results with the default value.
*   In summary, RMSprop is an extension of Adagrad that deals with its radically diminishing learning rates. It is identical to Adadelta, except that Adadelta uses the RMS of parameter updates in the numerator update rule. Adam, finally, adds bias-correction and momentum to RMSprop. Insofar, RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam are very similar algorithms that do well in similar circumstances. Kingma et al. [10] show that its bias-correction helps Adam slightly outperform RMSprop towards the end of optimization as gradients become sparser. Insofar, Adam might be the best overall choice




## TRAIN / VAL accuracy in NN

The second important quantity to track while training a classifier is the validation/training accuracy. This plot can give you valuable insights into the amount of overfitting in your model:

![alt_text](images/image181.jpg "image_tooltip")




*   The gap between the training and validation accuracy indicates the amount of overfitting. 
*   Two possible cases are shown in the diagram on the left. The blue validation error curve shows very small validation accuracy compared to the training accuracy, indicating strong overfitting (note, it's possible for the validation accuracy to even start to go down after some point). 
*   NOTE: When you see this in practice you probably want to increase regularization:
    *   **stronger L2 weight penalty**
    *   **Dropout**
    *   **collect more data**.
*    The other possible case is when the validation accuracy tracks the training accuracy fairly well. This case indicates that your model capacity is not high enough: **make the model larger by increasing the number of parameters.**


## INITIALIZERS

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">XAVIER GLOROT:</span>

[Whyâs Xavier initialization important?](http://andyljones.tumblr.com/post/110998971763/an-explanation-of-xavier-initialization)

In short, it helps signals reach deep into the network.



*   If the weights in a network start too small, then the signal shrinks as it passes through each layer until itâs too tiny to be useful.
*   If the weights in a network start too large, then the signal grows as it passes through each layer until itâs too massive to be useful.

Xavier initialization makes sure the weights are âjust rightâ, keeping the signal in a reasonable range of values through many layers.

To go any further than this, youâre going to need a small amount of statistics - specifically you need to know about random distributions and their variance.

[When to use glorot uniform-over-normal initialization?](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/13061/when-to-use-he-or-glorot-normal-initialization-over-uniform-init-and-what-are)

However, i am still not seeing anything empirical that says that glorot surpesses everything else under certain conditions ([except the glorot paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf)), most importantly, does it really help in LSTM where the vanishing gradient is ~no longer an issue?

[He-et-al Initialization](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-initialization-for-neural-networks-a-thing-of-the-past-bfcdd806bf9e)

This method of initializing became famous through a paper submitted in 2015 by He et al, and is similar to Xavier initialization, with the factor multiplied by two. In this method, the weights are initialized keeping in mind the size of the previous layer which helps in attaining a global minimum of the cost function faster and more efficiently.

w=np.random.randn(layer_size[l],layer_size[l-1])*np.sqrt(2/layer_size[l-1])




## ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS

([a bunch of observations, seems like a personal list](http://sentiment-mining.blogspot.co.il/2015/08/the-difference-of-activation-function.html)) - 



*   Output layer - linear for regression, softmax for classification
*   Hidden layers - hyperbolic tangent for shallow networks (less than 3 hidden layers), and ReLU for deep networks

**ReLU **- The purpose of ReLU is to **introduce non-linearity**, since most of the real-world data we would want our network to learn would be nonlinear (e.g. convolution is a linear operation â element wise matrix multiplication and addition, so we account for nonlinearity by introducing a nonlinear function like ReLU, e.g [here](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/) - search for ReLU).



*   Relu is quite **resistant to vanishing gradient** & allows for deactivating neurons and for sparsity.
*   Other nonlinear functions such as tanh or sigmoid can also be used instead of ReLU, but **ReLU has been found to perform better in most situations**.

## OPTIMIZERS

There are several optimizers, each had his 15 minutes of fame, some optimizers are recommended for CNN, Time Series, etc..

There are also what I call âexperimentalâ optimizers, it seems like these pop every now and then, with or without a formal proof. It is recommended to follow the literature and see what are the âsupposedlyâ state of the art optimizers atm.

[Adamod](https://medium.com/@lessw/meet-adamod-a-new-deep-learning-optimizer-with-memory-f01e831b80bd) deeplearning optimizer with memory

[Backstitch](http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2017_nips_backstitch.pdf) - September 17 - supposedly an improvement over SGD for speech recognition using DNN. **Note: it wasnt tested with other datasets or other network types.**

(how does it work?) **take a negative step back, then a positive step forward**. I.e., When processing a minibatch, instead of taking a single SGD step, we first take a step with âÎ± times the current learning rate, for Î± > 0 (e.g. Î± = 0.3), and then a step with 1 + Î± times the learning rate, with the same minibatch (and a recomputed gradient). So we are taking a small negative step, and then a larger positive step. This resulted in quite large improvements â around 10% relative improvement [37] â for our best speech recognition DNNs. **The recommended hyper parameters are in the paper.**

**Drawbacks**: takes twice to train, momentum not implemented or tested, dropout is mandatory for improvement, slow starter.

*   SGD can be fine tuned
*   For others Leave most parameters as they were

## DROPOUT LAYERS IN KERAS AND GENERAL

**[A very influential paper about dropout and how beneficial it is - bottom line always use it.](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf)**

**OPEN QUESTIONs: **



1. **does a dropout layer improve performance even if an lstm layer has dropout or recurrent dropout.**
2. **What is the diff between a separate layer and inside the lstm layer.**
3. **What is the diff in practice and intuitively between drop and recurrentdrop**

[Dropout layers in keras, or dropout regularization: ](https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-regularization-deep-learning-models-keras/)



*   Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored RANDOMLY during training. 
*   contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass.
*   As a neural network learns, neuron weights settle into their context within the network.
*   Weights of neurons are tuned for specific features providing some specialization. **Neighboring neurons become to rely on this specialization,** which if taken too far can result in a fragile model too specialized to the training data. (overfitting)
*   **This reliant on context for a neuron during training is referred to complex co-adaptations.**
*   After dropout,** other neurons will have to step in and handle the representation required to make predictions for the missing neurons,** which is believed to result in multiple independent internal representations being learned by the network.
*   **Thus, the effect of dropout is that the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons**. 
*   This in turn leads to a network with better generalization capability and less likely to overfit the training data.

[Another great answer about drop out](https://www.quora.com/In-Keras-what-is-a-dense-and-a-dropout-layer) - 



*   as a consequence of the 50% dropout, the neural network will learn different, redundant representations; **the network canât rely on the particular neurons and the combination** (or interaction) of these to be present. 
*   Another nice side effect is that training will be faster.
*   Rules: 
    *   Dropout is only applied during training, 
    *   Need to rescale the remaining neuron activations. E.g., if you set 50% of the activations in a given layer to zero, you need to scale up the remaining ones by a factor of 2. 
    *   if the training has finished, youâd use the complete network for testing (or in other words, you set the dropout probability to 0).

[Implementation of drop out in keras ](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/18088/convolutional-layer-dropout-layer-in-keras/18098)is âinverse dropoutâ -  n the Keras implementation, the output values are corrected during training (by dividing, in addition to randomly dropping out the values) instead of during testing (by multiplying). This is called "inverted dropout".

Inverted dropout is functionally equivalent to original dropout (as per your link to Srivastava's paper), with a nice feature that the network does not use dropout layers at all during test and prediction.

*   dropout value of 20%-50% of neurons with 20% providing a good starting point. (A probability too low has minimal effect and a value too high results in underlearning by the network.)
*   Use a large network for better performance, i.e.,  when dropout is used on a larger network, giving the model more of an opportunity to learn independent representations.
*   Use dropout on VISIBLE AND HIDDEN. Application of dropout at each layer of the network has shown good results.
*   **Unclear ?** Use a large learning rate with decay and a large momentum. Increase your learning rate by a factor of 10 to 100 and use a high momentum value of 0.9 or 0.99.
*   **Unclear ? **Constrain the size of network weights. A large learning rate can result in very large network weights. Imposing a constraint on the size of network weights such as max-norm regularization with a size of 4 or 5 has been shown to improve results.

[Difference between LSTM âdropoutâ and ârecurrent_dropoutâ ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44924690/keras-the-difference-between-lstm-dropout-and-lstm-recurrent-dropout)- vertical vs horizontal.

I suggest taking a look at (the first part of) [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05287.pdf). Regular dropout is applied on the inputs and/or the outputs, meaning the vertical arrows from `x_t` and to `h_t`. In you add it as an argument to your layer, it will mask the inputs; you can add a Dropout layer after your recurrent layer to mask the outputs as well. Recurrent dropout masks (or "drops") the connections between the recurrent units; that would be the horizontal arrows in your picture.

This picture is taken from the paper above. On the left, regular dropout on inputs and outputs. On the right, regular dropout PLUS recurrent dropout:

When you do multi-GPU training, it is important to feed all the GPUs with data. It can happen that the very last batch of your epoch has less data than defined (because the size of your dataset can not be divided exactly by the size of your batch). This might cause some GPUs not to receive any data during the last step. Unfortunately some Keras Layers, most notably the Batch Normalization Layer, canât cope with that leading to nan values appearing in the weights (the running mean and variance in the BN layer).

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">.predict() generates output predictions based on the input you pass it (for example, the predicted characters in the [MNIST example](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_mlp.py))</span>**

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">.evaluate() computes the loss based on the input you pass it, along with any other metrics that you requested in the metrics param when you compiled your model (such as accuracy in the [MNIST example](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_mlp.py))</span>**


#### Keras metrics

[For classification methods - how does keras calculate accuracy, all functions.](https://www.quora.com/How-does-Keras-calculate-accuracy)




#### LOSS IN KERAS

[Why is the training loss much higher than the testing loss?](https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#why-is-the-training-loss-much-higher-than-the-testing-loss) A Keras model has two modes: training and testing. Regularization mechanisms, such as Dropout and L1/L2 weight regularization, are turned off at testing time.

The training loss is the average of the losses over each batch of training data. Because your model is changing over time, the loss over the first batches of an epoch is generally higher than over the last batches. On the other hand, the testing loss for an epoch is computed using the model as it is at the end of the epoch, resulting in a lower loss.

### NEURO EVOLUTION (GA/GP based)


#### NEAT

[NEAT](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html) stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies. It is a method for evolving artificial neural networks with a genetic algorithm. \
 \
NEAT implements the idea that it is most effective to start evolution with small, simple networks and allow them to become increasingly complex over generations. 

 \
That way, just as organisms in nature increased in complexity since the first cell, so do neural networks in NEAT.  \
 \
This process of continual elaboration allows finding highly sophisticated and complex neural networks.

[A great article about NEAT](http://hunterheidenreich.com/blog/neuroevolution-of-augmenting-topologies/)


#### HYPER-NEAT

[HyperNEAT](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/) computes the connectivity of its neural networks as a function of their geometry.  \
 \
HyperNEAT is based on a theory of representation that hypothesizes that a good representation for an artificial neural network should be able to describe its pattern of connectivity compactly. \


The encoding in HyperNEAT, called [compositional pattern producing networks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network), is designed to represent patterns with regularities such as symmetry, repetition, and repetition with variation×¥  \

### Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)

The [RBFN ](http://mccormickml.com/2013/08/15/radial-basis-function-network-rbfn-tutorial/)approach is more intuitive than the MLP. 



*   An RBFN performs classification by **measuring the inputâs similarity to examples from the training set. **
*   Each RBFN neuron **stores a âprototype**â, which is just **one of the examples from the training set. **
*   When we want to **classify a new input**, each neuron **computes the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype**. 
*   Roughly speaking, if the input more closely resembles the class A prototypes than the class B prototypes, it is classified as class A.

### Bayesian Neural Network (BNN)

**[BNN ](https://eng.uber.com/neural-networks-uncertainty-estimation/)-**  (what is?) [Bayesian neural network (BNN)](http://edwardlib.org/tutorials/bayesian-neural-network) according to Uber - **architecture that more accurately forecasts time series predictions and uncertainty estimations at scale. **âhow Uber has successfully applied this model to large-scale time series anomaly detection, enabling better accommodate rider demand during high-traffic intervals.â

Under the BNN framework, prediction uncertainty can be categorized into three types: 



1. **Model uncertainty** captures our ignorance of the model parameters and **can be reduced as more samples are collected. **
2. **model misspecification**
3. **inherent noise** captures the uncertainty in the data generation process and **is irreducible**. 

Note: in a series of articles, uber explains about time series and leads to a BNN architecture.



1. [Neural networks](https://eng.uber.com/neural-networks/) - training on multi-signal raw data, training X and Y are window-based and the window size(lag) is determined in advance.

Regarding point 1: â**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">run prediction with dropout 100 times</span>**â

*** [MEDIUM with code how to do it.](https://medium.com/hal24k-techblog/how-to-generate-neural-network-confidence-intervals-with-keras-e4c0b78ebbdf)

[Why do we need a confidence measure when we have a softmax probability layer?](https://hjweide.github.io/quantifying-uncertainty-in-neural-networks) The blog post explains, for example, that with a CNN of apples, oranges, cat and dogs, a non related example such as a frog image may influence the network to decide its an apple, therefore we canât rely on the probability as a confidence measure. The â**run prediction with dropout 100 times**â should give us a confidence measure because it draws each weight from a bernoulli distribution.

_âBy applying dropout to all the weight layers in a neural network, we are essentially drawing each weight from a [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution). In practice, this mean that we can sample from the distribution by running several forward passes through the network. This is referred to as [Monte Carlo dropout](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02158).â_

Taken from Yarin Galâs [blog post ](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_3d801aa532c1ce.html). In this figure we see how sporadic is the signal from a forward pass (black line) compared to a much cleaner signal from 100 dropout passes.

**Is it applicable for time series?** In the figure below he tried to predict the missing signal between each two dotted lines, A is a bad estimation, but with a dropout layer we can see that in most cases the signal is better predicted.

[Phd Thesis by Yarin](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_2248.html?fref=gc&dti=999449923520287), he talks about uncertainty in Neural networks and using BNNs. he may have proved this thesis, but I did not read it. This blog post links to his full Phd.

**Old note: [The idea behind uncertainty is (paper here](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_3d801aa532c1ce.html)**)  that in order to trust your networkâs classification, you drop some of the neurons during prediction, you do this ~100 times and you average the results. Intuitively this will give you confidence in your classification and increase your classification accuracy, because only a partial part of your network participated in the classification, randomly, 100 times. **Please note that Softmax doesn't give you certainty.**

*   **Spatial Pooling** (also called subsampling or downsampling) reduces the dimensionality of each feature map but retains the most important information. Spatial Pooling can be of different types: Max, Average, Sum etc.
*   **Dense / Fully Connected - **a traditional Multi Layer Perceptron that **uses a softmax** **activation **function in the output layer to classify. The output from the convolutional and pooling layers represent high-level features of the input image. The purpose of the Fully Connected layer is to use these features for **classifying the input image into various classes** based on the training dataset.

The overall training process of the Convolutional Network may be summarized as below:



*   Step1: We **initialize **all **filters **and **parameters **/ **weights **with random values
*   Step2: The network **takes a single training image** as input, **goes through the forward** propagation step (convolution, ReLU and pooling operations along with forward propagation in the Fully Connected layer) and finds the output probabilities for each class.
    *   Let's say the output probabilities for the boat image above are [0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.3]
    *   **Since weights are randomly assigned for the first training example, output probabilities are also random**.
*   Step3: **Calculate the total error** at the output layer (summation over all 4 classes)
    *    (L2) Total Error = â  Â½ (target probability â output probability) Â²
*   Step4: Use **Backpropagation **to calculate the gradients of the error with respect to all weights in the network and use gradient descent to update all filter values / weights and parameter values **to minimize the output error.**
    *   **The weights are adjusted in proportion to their contribution to the total error.**
    *   When the same image is input again, output probabilities might now be [0.1, 0.1, 0.7, 0.1], which is closer to the target vector [0, 0, 1, 0].
    *   This means that the network has learnt to classify this particular image correctly by adjusting its weights / filters such that the output error is reduced.
    *   Parameters like number of filters, filter sizes, architecture of the network etc. have all been fixed before Step 1 and do not change during training process â only the values of the filter matrix and connection weights get updated.
*   Step5: **Repeat steps 2-4 with all images in the training set.**

The above steps train the ConvNet â this essentially means that all the weights and parameters of the ConvNet have now been optimized to correctly classify images from the training set.

When a new (unseen) image is input into the ConvNet, the network would go through the forward propagation step and output a probability for each class (for a new image, the output probabilities are calculated using the weights which have been optimized to correctly classify all the previous training examples). If our training set is large enough, the network will (hopefully) generalize well to new images and classify them into correct categories.

#### MAX AVERAGE POOLING

[Intuitions to the differences between max and average pooling:](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/291451/feature-extracted-by-max-pooling-vs-mean-pooling)



1. A max-pool layer compressed by taking the maximum activation in a block. If you have a block with mostly small activation, but a small bit of large activation, you will loose the information on the low activations. I think of this as saying "this type of feature was detected in this general area". 
2. A mean-pool layer compresses by taking the mean activation in a block. If large activations are balanced by negative activations, the overall compressed activations will look like no activation at all. On the other hand, you retain some information about low activations in the previous example.
3. MAX pooling In other words: Max pooling roughly means that only those features that are most strongly triggering outputs are used in the subsequent layers. You can look at it a little like focusing the networkâs attention on whatâs most characteristic for the image at hand.
4. [GLOBAL MAX pooling](https://alexisbcook.github.io/2017/global-average-pooling-layers-for-object-localization/): In the last few years, experts have turned to global average pooling (GAP) layers to minimize overfitting by reducing the total number of parameters in the model. Similar to max pooling layers, GAP layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a three-dimensional tensor. However, GAP layers perform a more extreme type of dimensionality reduction,

*   N to 1 = classification
*   N to N = predict frames in a movie

*   Vanishing gradient is 100 times worse.
*   Gate networks like LSTM solves vanishing gradient.

[RNNCELLS - recurrent shop](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/recurrentshop), enables you to build complex rnns with keras. Details on their significance are inside the link

Masking for RNNs - the ideas is simple, we want to use variable length inputs, although rnns do use that, they require a fixed size input. So masking of 1âs and 0âs will help it understand the real size or where the information is in the input. Motivation: Padded inputs are going to contribute to our loss and we dont want that.

It loops for each time step! \
I.e., The TimeDistributed achieves this **trick **by applying the same Dense layer (same weights) to the LSTMs outputs for one time step at a time. In this way, the output layer only needs one connection to each LSTM unit (plus one bias).

[Validation_split arg](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-the-validation-split-variable-in-Keras) - The validation split variable in Keras is a value between [0..1]. Keras proportionally split your training set by the value of the variable. The first set is used for training and the 2nd set for validation after each epoch. 

This is a nice helper add-on by Keras, and most other Keras examples you have seen the training and test set was passed into the fit method, after you have manually made the split. The value of having a validation set is significant and is a vital step to understand how well your model is training. Ideally on a curve you want your training accuracy to be close to your validation curve, and the moment your validation curve falls below your training curve the alarm bells should go off and your model is probably busy over-fitting.

Keras is a wonderful framework for deep learning, and there are many different ways of doing things with plenty of helpers.

#### BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM

(what is?) Wiki -  The basic idea of BRNNs is to connect two hidden layers of opposite directions to the same output. By this structure, the output layer can get information from past and future states.

BRNN are especially useful when the context of the input is needed. For example, in handwriting recognition, the performance can be enhanced by knowledge of the letters located before and after the current letter.

[Another ](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-bidirectional-lstm-sequence-classification-python-keras/)explanation- It involves duplicating the first recurrent layer in the network so that there are now two layers side-by-side, then providing the input sequence as-is as input to the first layer and providing a reversed copy of the input sequence to the second.

.. It allows you to specify the merge mode, that is how the forward and backward outputs should be combined before being passed on to the next layer. The options are:



*   **âsumâ**: The outputs are added together.
*   **âmulâ**: The outputs are multiplied together.
*   **âconcatâ**: The outputs are concatenated together (the default), providing double the number of outputs to the next layer.
*   **âaveâ**: The average of the outputs is taken.

The default mode is to **concatenate**, and this is the method often used in studies of bidirectional LSTMs.

#### GRU

[A tutorial about GRU](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-gru-networks-2ef37df6c9be) - To solve the vanishing gradient problem of a standard RNN, GRU uses, so called, update gate and reset gate. Basically, these are two vectors which decide what information should be passed to the output. The special thing about them is that they can be trained to keep information from long ago, without washing it through time or remove information which is irrelevant to the prediction.



1. **update gate **helps the model to determine how much of the past information (from previous time steps) needs to be passed along to the future.
2. **Reset gate **essentially, this gate is used from the model to decide how much of the past information to forget.

    , [git](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/Splitter), [paper](http://epasto.org/papers/www2019splitter.pdf), âIs a Single Embedding Enough? Learning Node Representations that Capture Multiple Social Contextsâ


    Recent interest in graph embedding methods has focused on learning a single representation for each node in the graph. But can nodes really be best described by a single vector representation? In this work, we propose a method for learning multiple representations of the nodes in a graph (e.g., the users of a social network). Based on a principled decomposition of the ego-network, each representation encodes the role of the node in a different local community in which the nodes participate. These representations allow for improved reconstruction of the nuanced relationships that occur in the graph a phenomenon that we illustrate through state-of-the-art results on link prediction tasks on a variety of graphs, reducing the error by up to 90%. In addition, we show that these embeddings allow for effective visual analysis of the learned community structure.

The classical Lottery Ticket Hypothesis was mostly tested with unstructured pruning, specifically **magnitude pruning (m-pruning**) where the weights with the lowest magnitude are pruned irrespective of their position in the model. We iteratively prune 10% of the least magnitude weights across the entire fine-tuned model (except the embeddings) and evaluate on dev set, for as long as the performance of the pruned subnetwork is above 90% of the full model.

    We also experiment with **structured pruning (s-pruning**) of entire components of BERT architecture based on their importance scores: specifically, we 'remove' the least important self-attention heads and MLPs by applying a mask. In each iteration, we prune 10% of BERT heads and 1 MLP, for as long as the performance of the pruned subnetwork is above 90% of the full model. To determine which heads/MLPs to prune, we use a loss-based approximation: the importance scores proposed by [Michel, Levy and Neubig (2019)](https://thegradient.pub/when-bert-plays-the-lottery-all-tickets-are-winning/#RefMichel) for self-attention heads, which we extend to MLPs. Please see our paper and the original formulation for more details.

### Troubleshooting Neural Nets

([37 reasons](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.slavv.com/37-reasons-why-your-neural-network-is-not-working-4020854bd607?fref%3Dgc%26dti%3D543283492502370&sa=D&ust=1505196977713000&usg=AFQjCNHpCL1boTmKrBLBiaVFV4YxoxoroA), [10 more](http://theorangeduck.com/page/neural-network-not-working?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=The%20Wild%20Week%20in%20AI&fref=gc&dti=543283492502370)) - copy pasted and rewritten here for convenience, it's pretty thorough, but long and extensive, you should have some sort of intuition and not go through all of these. The following list is has much more insight and information in the article itself.

The author of the original article suggests to turn everything off and then start building your network step by step, i.e., âa divide and conquer âdebugâ methodâ.


#### Dataset Issues

1. Check your input data - for stupid mistakes

2. Try random input - if the error behaves the same on random data, there is a problem in the net. Debug layer by layer

3. Check the data loader - input data is possibly broken. Check the input layer.

4. Make sure input is connected to output - do samples have correct labels, even after shuffling?

5. Is the relationship between input and output too random? - the input are not sufficiently related to the output. Its pretty amorphic, just look at the data.

6. Is there too much noise in the dataset? - badly labelled datasets.

7. Shuffle the dataset - useful to counteract order in the DS, always shuffle input and labels together.

8. Reduce class imbalance - imbalance datasets may add a bias to class prediction. Balance your class, your loss, do something.

9. Do you have enough training examples? - training from scratch? ~1000 images per class, ~probably similar numbers for other types of samples.

**10. Make sure your batches donât contain a single label - this is probably something you wont notice and will waste a lot of time figuring out! **In certain cases shuffle the DS to prevent batches from having the same label.

11. Reduce batch size - [This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836) points out that having a very large batch can reduce the generalization ability of the model. However, please note that I found other references that claim a too small batch will impact performance.

**12. Test on well known Datasets**



---



#### Data Normalization/Augmentation

12. Standardize the features - zero mean and unit variance, sounds like normalization.

13. Do you have too much data augmentation?

Augmentation has a regularizing effect. Too much of this combined with other forms of regularization (weight L2, dropout, etc.) can cause the net to underfit.

14. **Check the preprocessing of your pretrained model - with a pretrained model make sure your input data is similar in range[0, 1], [-1, 1] or [0, 255]?**

15. Check the preprocessing for train/validation/test set - CS231n points out a [common pitfall](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-2/#datapre):

Any preprocessing should be computed ONLY on the training data, then applied to val/test



---



#### Implementation issues

16. Try solving a simpler version of the problem -divide and conquer prediction, i.e., class and box coordinates, just use one.

17. Look for correct loss âat chanceâ - calculat loss for chance level, i.e 10% baseline is -ln(0.1) = 2.3 Softmax loss is the negative log probability. Afterwards increase regularization strength which should increase the loss.

18. Check your custom loss function.

19. Verify loss input - parameter confusion.

20. Adjust loss weights -If your loss is composed of several smaller loss functions, make sure their magnitude relative to each is correct. This might involve testing different combinations of loss weights.

21. Monitor other metrics -like accuracy.

22. Test any custom layers, debugging them.

23. Check for âfrozenâ layers or variables - accidentally frozen?

24. Increase network size - more layers, more neurons.

25. Check for hidden dimension errors - confusion due to vectors ->(64, 64, 64)

26. Explore Gradient checking -does your backprop work for custon gradients? [1](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/DebuggingGradientChecking/) [2](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#gradcheck) [3](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Y3s6r/gradient-checking).



---



#### Training issues

27. Solve for a really small dataset - can you generalize on 2 samples?

28. Check weights initialization - [Xavier](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) or [He](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/He_Delving_Deep_into_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf) or forget about it for networks such as RNN.

29. Change your hyperparameters - grid search

30. Reduce regularization - too much may underfit, try for dropout, batch norm, weight, bias , L2.

31. Give it more training  time as long as the loss is decreasing.

32. Switch from Train to Test mode - not clear.

33. Visualize the training - activations, weights, layer updates, biases. [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard) and [Crayon](https://github.com/torrvision/crayon). Tips on [Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/visualization#usingui). Expect gaussian distribution for weights, biases start at 0 and end up almost gaussian. Keep an eye out for parameters that are diverging to +/- infinity. **Keep an eye out for biases that become very large. **This can sometimes occur in the output layer for classification if the distribution of classes is very imbalanced.

34. Try a different optimizer, Check this [excellent post](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) about  gradient descent optimizers.

35. Exploding / Vanishing gradients - Gradient clipping may help. Tips on: [Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/visualization#usingui): âA good standard deviation for the activations is on the order of **0.5 to 2.0. Significantly outside of this range may indicate vanishing or exploding activations.â**

36. Increase/Decrease Learning Rate, or use adaptive learning

37. Overcoming NaNs, big issue for RNN - decrease LR, [how to deal with NaNs](http://russellsstewart.com/notes/0.html). evaluate layer by layer, why does it appear.




## EMBEDDINGS


### TOOLS


#### [FLAIR](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/02/flair-nlp-library-python/)



1. **Name-Entity Recognition (NER):** It can recognise whether a word represents a person, location or names in the text.
2. **Parts-of-Speech Tagging (PoS):** Tags all the words in the given text as to which âpart of speechâ they belong to.
3. **Text Classification:** Classifying text based on the criteria (labels)
4. **Training Custom Models:** Making our own custom models.
5. It **comprises of popular and state-of-the-art word embeddings**, such as GloVe, BERT, ELMo, Character Embeddings, etc. There are very easy to use thanks to the Flair API
6. Flairâs interface allows us to **combine different word embeddings** and use them to embed documents. This in turn leads to a significant uptick in results
7. âFlair Embeddingâ is the signature embedding provided within the Flair library. It is powered by contextual string embeddings. Weâll understand this concept in detail in the next section
8. Flair supports a number of languages â and is always looking to add new ones

#### Language modelling



1. **[Ruder on language modelling as the next imagenet](http://ruder.io/nlp-imagenet/) - **Language modelling, the last approach mentioned, has been shown to capture many facets of language relevant for downstream tasks, such as [long-term dependencies ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01368), [hierarchical relations ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11138), and [sentiment ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01444). Compared to related unsupervised tasks such as skip-thoughts and autoencoding, [language modelling performs better on syntactic tasks even with less training data](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJeYYeaVJ7).
2. **A [tutorial ](https://blog.myyellowroad.com/unsupervised-sentence-representation-with-deep-learning-104b90079a93)about w2v skipthought - with code!, specifically language modelling here is important - **Our second method is training a language model to represent our sentences. A language model describes the probability of a text existing in a language. For example, the sentence âI like eating bananasâ would be more probable than âI like eating convolutions.â We train a language model by slicing windows of n words and predicting what the next word will be in the text

4. **ELMO - [medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/beyond-word-embeddings-part-2-word-vectors-nlp-modeling-from-bow-to-bert-4ebd4711d0ec)**
5. **[Bert](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805v1) [python git](https://github.com/CyberZHG/keras-bert)- **We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for **Bidirectional Encoder Representations** from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by **jointly conditioning on both left and right context** in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT representations can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks. \

6. [Open.ai on language modelling ](https://blog.openai.com/language-unsupervised/)- Weâve obtained state-of-the-art results on a suite of diverse language tasks with a scalable, task-agnostic system, which weâre also releasing. Our approach is a combination of two existing ideas: [transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) and [unsupervised pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01432).

12. [Skip-thought - git](http://mlexplained.com/2017/12/28/an-overview-of-sentence-embedding-methods/)- Where word2vec attempts to predict surrounding words from certain words in a sentence, skip-thought vector extends this idea to sentences: it **predicts surrounding sentences from a given sentence**. NOTE: Unlike the other methods, skip-thought vectors **require the sentences to be ordered in a semantically meaningful way.** This makes this method difficult to use for domains such as social media text, where each snippet of text exists in isolation.
13. [Fastsent ](http://mlexplained.com/2017/12/28/an-overview-of-sentence-embedding-methods/)- Skip-thought vectors are **slow to train**. FastSent attempts to remedy this inefficiency while expanding on the core idea of skip-thought: that predicting surrounding sentences is a powerful way to obtain distributed representations. Formally, FastSent represents sentences as the simple sum of its word embeddings, making training efficient. The word embeddings are learned so that the inner product between the sentence embedding and the word embeddings of surrounding sentences is maximized. NOTE: FastSent sacrifices word order for the sake of efficiency, which can be a large disadvantage depending on the use-case.
14. Weighted sum of words - In this method, each word vector is weighted by the factor

 is the (estimated) word frequency. This is similar to tf-idf weighting, where more frequent terms are weighted downNOTE: Word order and surrounding sentences are ignored as well, limiting the information that is encoded.
15. [Infersent by facebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent) - [paper ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364) InferSent is a sentence embeddings method that provides semantic representations for English sentences. It is trained on natural language inference data and generalizes well to many different tasks. ABSTRACT: we show how **universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference datasets can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought** vectors on a wide range of transfer tasks. Much like how computer vision uses ImageNet to obtain features, which can then be transferred to other tasks, our work tends to indicate the suitability of natural language inference for transfer learning to other NLP tasks.

The model is trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide variety of natural language understanding tasks. The input is variable length English text and the output is a 512 dimensional vector. We apply this model to the [STS benchmark](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) for semantic similarity, and the results can be seen in the [example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/hub/blob/master/examples/colab/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder.ipynb) made available. The universal-sentence-encoder model is trained with a deep averaging network (DAN) encoder.

Experiments show that our pair embeddings can complement individual word embeddings, and that they are perhaps capturing information that eludes the traditional interpretation of the Distributional Hypothesis**

    2. [Semantic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48356421/what-is-the-difference-between-syntactic-analogy-and-semantic-analogy) tasks mean meaning related, a higher level of the language tree, these also typically involve a higher level understanding of the text and might involve tasks s.a. question answering, sentiment analysis, etc...
    3. As for analogies, he is referring to the mathematical operator like properties exhibited by word embedding, in this context a syntactic analogy would be related to plurals, tense or gender, those sort of things, and semantic analogy would be word meaning relationships s.a. man + queen = king, etc...

With negative sampling, we are instead going to randomly select just a small number of ânegativeâ words (letâs say 5) to update the weights for. (In this context, a ânegativeâ word is one for which we want the network to output a 0 for). We will also still update the weights for our âpositiveâ word (which is the word âquickâ in our current example). The ânegative samplesâ (that is, the 5 output words that weâll train to output 0) are chosen using a âunigram distributionâ. Essentially, the probability for selecting a word as a negative sample is related to its frequency, with more frequent words being more likely to be selected as negative samples.

Instead of extracting the embeddings from a neural network that is designed to perform a surrogate task (predicting neighbouring words), the embeddings are optimized directly so that the dot product of two word vectors equals the log of the number of times the two words will occur near each other (within 5 words for example). For example if "dog" and "cat" occur near each other 10 times in a corpus, then vec(dog) dot vec(cat) = log(10). This forces the vectors to somehow encode the frequency distribution of which words occur near them.â

#### BERT/ROBERTA



1. [Do attention heads in bert roberta track syntactic dependencies?](https://medium.com/@phu_pmh/do-attention-heads-in-bert-track-syntactic-dependencies-81c8a9be311a) - tl;dr: The attention weights between tokens in BERT/RoBERTa bear similarity to some syntactic dependency relations, but the results are less conclusive than weâd like as they donât significantly outperform linguistically uninformed baselines for all types of dependency relations. In the case of MAX, our results indicate that specific heads in the BERT models may correspond to certain dependency relations, whereas for MST, we find much less support âgeneralistâ heads whose attention weights correspond to a full syntactic dependency structure.

    In both cases, the metrics do not appear to be representative of the extent of linguistic knowledge learned by the BERT models, based on their strong performance on many NLP tasks. Hence, our takeaway is that while we can tease out some structure from the attention weights of BERT models using the above methods, studying the attention weights alone is unlikely to give us the full picture of BERTâs strength processing natural language.

11. [Large memory layers with product keys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05242) - This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. 
12. [Adaptive sparse transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00015) - This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with 

    Î±-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the 


    Î± parameter -- which controls the shape and sparsity of 


    Î±-entmax -- allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets.

    **Pruning** - Removes unnecessary parts of the network after training. This includes weight magnitude pruning, attention head pruning, layers, and others. Some methods also impose regularization during training to increase prunability (layer dropout).


    **Weight Factorization** - Approximates parameter matrices by factorizing them into a multiplication of two smaller matrices. This imposes a low-rank constraint on the matrix. Weight factorization can be applied to both token embeddings (which saves a lot of memory on disk) or parameters in feed-forward / self-attention layers (for some speed improvements).


    **Knowledge Distillation** - Aka âStudent Teacher.â Trains a much smaller Transformer from scratch on the pre-training / downstream-data. Normally this would fail, but utilizing soft labels from a fully-sized model improves optimization for unknown reasons. Some methods also distill BERT into different architectures (LSTMS, etc.) which have faster inference times. Others dig deeper into the teacher, looking not just at the output but at weight matrices and hidden activations.


    **Weight Sharing** - Some weights in the model share the same value as other parameters in the model. For example, ALBERT uses the same weight matrices for every single layer of self-attention in BERT.


    **Quantization** - Truncates floating point numbers to only use a few bits (which causes round-off error). The quantization values can also be learned either during or after training.


    **Pre-train vs. Downstream** - Some methods only compress BERT w.r.t. certain downstream tasks. Others compress BERT in a way that is task-agnostic.

### OPEN AI GPT



1. [the GPT-2](https://medium.com/dair-ai/experimenting-with-openais-improved-language-model-abf73bc123b9) small algorithm was trained on the task of language modelingâââwhich tests a programâs ability to predict the next word in a given sentenceâââby ingesting huge numbers of articles, blogs, and websites. By using just this data it achieved state-of-the-art scores on a number of unseen language tests, an achievement known as zero-shot learning. It can also perform other writing-related tasks, such as translating text from one language to another, summarizing long articles, and answering trivia questions.

## Adversarial methodologies



1. What is label [flipping and smoothing](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/55359/how-label-smoothing-and-label-flipping-increases-the-performance-of-a-machine-le/56662) and usage for making a model more robust against adversarial methodologies - 0

    Label flipping is a training technique where one selectively manipulates the labels in order to make the model more robust against label noise and associated attacks - the specifics depend a lot on the nature of the noise. Label flipping bears no benefit only under the assumption that all labels are (and will always be) correct and that no adversaries exist. In cases where noise tolerance is desirable, training with label flipping is beneficial.


    Label smoothing is a regularization technique (and then some) aimed at improving model performance. Its effect takes place irrespective of label correctness.

2. [ Paper: when does label smoothing helps?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02629) Smoothing the labels in this way prevents the network from becoming overconfident and label smoothing has been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image classification, language translation and speech recognition...Here we show empirically that in addition to improving generalization, label smoothing improves model calibration which can significantly improve beam-search. However, **we also observe that if a teacher network is trained with label smoothing, knowledge distillation into a student network is much less effective.**

5. [Adversarial label flips attacks on svm](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.398.7446&rep=rep1&type=pdf) - To develop a robust classification algorithm in the adversarial setting, it is important to understand the adversaryâs strategy. We address the problem of label flips attack where an adversary contaminates the training set through flipping labels. By analyzing the objective of the adversary, we formulate an optimization framework for finding the label flips that maximize the classification error. An algorithm for attacking support vector machines is derived. Experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of classifiers is significantly degraded under the attack.

## TF-IDF

[TF-IDF](http://www.tfidf.com/) - how important is a word to a document in a corpus


    TF(t) = (Number of times term t appears in a document) / (Total number of terms in the document).


    Frequency of word in doc / all words in document (normalized bcz docs have diff sizes)


    IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it).


    measures how important a term is


    TF-IDF is TF*IDF

**Phrase modelling**



1. [Phrase Modeling](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/conference_notebooks/modern_nlp_in_python.ipynb) - using gensim and spacy

    **_Phrase modeling_ is another approach to learning combinations of tokens that together represent meaningful multi-word concepts. We can develop phrase models by looping over the the words in our reviews and looking for words that _co-occur_ (i.e., appear one after another) together much more frequently than you would expect them to by random chance. The formula our phrase models will use to determine whether two tokens AA and BB constitute a phrase is:**


    **count(A B)âcountmincount(A)âcount(B)âN>threshold**

## ANNOTATION



1. **[Snorkel](https://www.snorkel.org/use-cases/) - using weak supervision to create less noisy labelled datasets**
    1. **[Git](https://github.com/snorkel-team/snorkel)**
    2. **[Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-snorkel-27e4b0e6ecff)**
2. **[Snorkel metal](https://jdunnmon.github.io/metal_deem.pdf) weak supervision for multi-task learning. [Conversation](https://spectrum.chat/snorkel/help/hierarchical-labelling-example~aa4d8617-d287-43a6-865e-7c9034888363), [git](https://github.com/HazyResearch/metal/blob/master/tutorials/Multitask.ipynb)**
    3. Yes, the Snorkel project has included work before on hierarchical labeling scenarios. The main papers detailing our results include the DEEM workshop paper you referenced ([https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3209889.3209898](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3209889.3209898)) and the more complete paper presented at AAAI ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02840](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02840)). Before the Snorkel and Snorkel MeTaL projects were merged in Snorkel v0.9, the Snorkel MeTaL project included an interface for explicitly specifying hierarchies between tasks which was utilized by the label model and could be used to automatically compile a multi-task end model as well (demo here:[ https://github.com/HazyResearch/metal/blob/master/tutorials/Multitask.ipynb](https://github.com/HazyResearch/metal/blob/master/tutorials/Multitask.ipynb)). That interface is not currently available in Snorkel v0.9 (no fundamental blockers; just hasn't been ported over yet).
    4. There are, however, still a number of ways to model such situations. One way is to treat each node in the hierarchy as a separate task and combine their probabilities post-hoc (e.g., P(credit-request) = P(billing) * P(credit-request | billing)). Another is to treat them as separate tasks and use a multi-task end model to implicitly learn how the predictions of some tasks should affect the predictions of others (e.g., the end model we use in the AAAI paper). A third option is to create a single task with all the leaf categories and modify the output space of the LFs you were considering for the higher nodes (the deeper your hierarchy is or the larger the number of classes, the less apppealing this is w/r/t to approaches 1 and 2).

Ideas: 



1. Active learning for a group (or single) of annotators, we have to wait for all annotations to finish each big batch in order to retrain the model.
2. Annotate a small group, automatic labelling using knn
3. Find a nearest neighbor for out optimal set of keywords per âcategory, 
4. For a group of keywords, find their knn neighbors in w2v-space, alternatively find k clusters in w2v space that has those keywords. For a new word/mean sentence vector in the âcategoryâ find the minimal distance to the new cluster (either one of approaches) and this is new annotation.


### [7 myths of annotation](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewFile/2564/2468)



1. Myth One: One Truth Most data collection efforts assume that there is one correct interpretation for every input example. 
2. Myth Two: Disagreement Is Bad To increase the quality of annotation data, disagreement among the annotators should be avoided or reduced. 
3. Myth Three: Detailed Guidelines Help When specific cases continuously cause disagreement, more instructions are added to limit interpretations. 
4. Myth Four: One Is Enough Most annotated examples are evaluated by one person. 
5. Myth Five: Experts Are Better Human annotators with domain knowledge provide better annotated data. 
6. Myth Six: All Examples Are Created Equal The mathematics of using ground truth treats every example the same; either you match the correct result or not. 
7. Myth Seven: Once Done, Forever Valid Once human annotated data is collected for a task, it is used over and over with no update. New annotated data is not aligned with previous data.

    **The Kappa statistic varies from 0 to 1, where.**

*   **0 = agreement equivalent to chance.**
*   **0.1 â 0.20 = slight agreement.**
*   **0.21 â 0.40 = fair agreement.**

*   **1 = perfect agreement.**
2. [Fleissâ kappa](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/fleiss-kappa/), from 3 people and above.

        **Kappa ranges from 0 to 1, where:**

*   **0 is no agreement (or agreement that you would expect to find by chance),**
*   **1 is perfect agreement.**
*   **Fleissâs Kappa is an extension of Cohenâs kappa for three raters or more. In addition, the assumption with Cohenâs kappa is that your raters are deliberately chosen and fixed. With Fleissâ kappa, the assumption is that your raters were chosen at random from a larger population.**
*   **[Kendallâs Tau](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/kendalls-tau/) is used when you have ranked data, like two people ordering 10 candidates from most preferred to least preferred.**

    6. a) identify which annotators are trustworthy and
    7.  b) predict the correct underlying labels. We match performance of more complex state-of-the-art systems and perform well even under adversarial conditions
    8. [MACE](https://www.isi.edu/publications/licensed-sw/mace/) does exactly that. It tries to find out which annotators are more trustworthy and upweighs their answers.
    9. [Git](https://github.com/dirkhovy/MACE) -

        ns (like those from Amazon's MechanicalTurk), we usually want to

1. aggregate annotations to recover the most likely answer
2. find out which annotators are trustworthy
3. evaluate item and task difficulty

        MACE solves all of these problems, by learning competence estimates for each annotators and computing the most likely answer based on those competences.

### Ground Truth 



1. For sentiment In Vader - 
    1. âScreening for English language reading comprehension â each rater had to individually score an 80% or higher on a standardized college-level reading comprehension test. 
    2. Complete an online sentiment rating training and orientation session, and score 90% or higher for matching the known (prevalidated) mean sentiment rating of lexical items which included individual words, emoticons, acronyms, sentences, tweets, and text snippets (e.g., sentence segments, or phrases). 
    3. Every batch of 25 features contained five âgolden itemsâ with a known (pre-validated) sentiment rating distribution. If a worker was more than one standard deviation away from the mean of this known distribution on three or more of the five golden items, we discarded all 25 ratings in the batch from this worker. 
    4. Bonus to incentivize and reward the highest quality work. Asked workers to select the valence score that they thought âmost other peopleâ would choose for the given lexical feature (early/iterative pilot testing revealed that wording the instructions in this manner garnered a much tighter standard deviation without significantly affecting the mean sentiment rating, allowing us to achieve higher quality (generalized) results while being more economical). 
    5. Compensated AMT workers $0.25 for each batch of 25 items they rated, with an additional $0.25 incentive bonus for all workers who successfully matched the group mean (within 1.5 standard deviations) on at least 20 of 25 responses in each batch. Using these four quality control methods, we achieved remarkable value in the data obtained from our AMT workers â we paid incentive bonuses for high quality to at least 90% of raters for most batches.

    [Multilingual Twitter Sentiment Classification: The Role of Human Annotators](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155036)



*   1.6 million tweets labelled
*   13 languages
*   Evaluated 6 pretrained classification models
*   10 CFV
*   SVM / NB
*   Annotator agreements. 
    *   about 15% were intentionally duplicated to be annotated twice,
    *   by the same annotator 
    *   by two different annotators 
*   Self-agreement from multiple annotations of the same annotator
*   Inter-agreement from multiple annotations by different annotators 
*   The confidence intervals for the agreements are estimated by bootstrapping [[12](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155036#pone.0155036.ref012)]. 
*   It turns out that the self-agreement is a good measure to identify low quality annotators, 
*   the inter-annotator agreement provides a good estimate of the objective difficulty of the task, unless it is too low.

_Alpha_ was developed to measure the agreement between human annotators, but can also be used to measure the agreement between classification models and a gold standard. It generalizes several specialized agreement measures, takes ordering of classes into account, and accounts for the agreement by chance. _Alpha_ is defined as follows:

### (LDA) Latent Dirichlet Allocation 

LDA is already taken by the above algorithm!

[Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) -](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/LDA) This algorithm takes a group of documents (anything that is made of up text), and returns a number of topics (which are made up of a number of words) most relevant to these documents. 



*   LDA is an example of topic modelling 
*   **?- can this be used for any set of features, not just text?**

    *   [LDA is a probabilistic](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40171208/scikit-learn-should-i-fit-model-with-tf-or-tf-idf) generative model that generates documents by sampling a topic for each word and then a word from the sampled topic. The generated document is represented as a bag of words.
    *   NMF is in its general definition the search for 2 matrices W and H such that W*H=V where V is an observed matrix. The only requirement for those matrices is that all their elements must be non negative.
    *   From the above definitions it is clear that in LDA only bag of words frequency counts can be used since a vector of reals makes no sense. Did we create a word 1.2 times? On the other hand we can use any non negative representation for NMF and in the example tf-idf is used.
    *   As far as choosing the number of iterations, for the NMF in scikit learn I don't know the stopping criterion although I believe it is the relative improvement of the loss function being smaller than a threshold so you 'll have to experiment. For LDA I suggest checking manually the improvement of the log likelihood in a held out validation set and stopping when it falls under a threshold.
    *   The rest of the parameters depend heavily on the data so I suggest, as suggested by @rpd, that you do a parameter search.
    *   So to sum up, LDA can only generate frequencies and NMF can generate any non negative matrix.
*

    1. It is unsupervised natively; it uses joint probability method to find topics(user has to pass # of topics to LDA api). If âDoc X wordâ is size of input data to LDA, it transforms it to 2 matrices:
    2. Doc X topic
    3. Word X topic
    4. further if you want, you can feed âDoc X topicâ matrix to supervised algorithm if labels were given.

    5. Text classification â Topic modeling can improve classification by grouping similar words together in topics rather than using each word as a feature
    6. Recommender Systems â Using a similarity measure we can build recommender systems. If our system would recommend articles for readers, it will recommend articles with a topic structure similar to the articles the user has already read.
    7. Uncovering Themes in Texts â Useful for detecting trends in online publications for example
    8. A Form of Tagging - If document classification is assigning a single category to a text, topic modeling is assigning multiple tags to a text. A human expert can label the resulting topics with human-readable labels and use different heuristics to convert the weighted topics to a set of tags.
    9. [Topic Modelling for Feature Selection](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/beginners-guide-to-topic-modeling-in-python/) - Sometimes LDA can also be used as feature selection technique. Take an example of text classification problem where the training data contain category wise documents. If LDA is running on sets of category wise documents. Followed by removing common topic terms across the results of different categories will give the best features for a category.

    <span style="text-decoration:underline;">How to interpret topics using pyldaviz**:**</span>


    Letâs interpret the topic visualization. Notice how topics are shown on the left while words are on the right. Here are the main things you should consider:

1. Larger topics are more frequent in the corpus.
2. Topics closer together are more similar, topics further apart are less similar.
3. When you select a topic, you can see the most representative words for the selected topic. This measure can be a combination of how frequent or how discriminant the word is. You can adjust the weight of each property using the slider.
4. Hovering over a word will adjust the topic sizes according to how representative the word is for the topic.

****[pyLDAviz paper***!](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LDAvis/vignettes/details.pdf)

[pyLDAviz - what am i looking at ? ](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/conference_notebooks/modern_nlp_in_python.ipynb)by spacy

There are a lot of moving parts in the visualization. Here's a brief summary:



*   On the left, there is a plot of the "distance" between all of the topics (labeled as the _Intertopic Distance Map_)
    *   The plot is rendered in two dimensions according a _[multidimensional scaling (MDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling)_ algorithm. Topics that are generally similar should be appear close together on the plot, while _dis_similar topics should appear far apart.
    *   The relative size of a topic's circle in the plot corresponds to the relative frequency of the topic in the corpus.
    *   An individual topic may be selected for closer scrutiny by clicking on its circle, or entering its number in the "selected topic" box in the upper-left.
*   On the right, there is a bar chart showing top terms.
    *   When no topic is selected in the plot on the left, the bar chart shows the top-30 most "salient" terms in the corpus. A term's _saliency_ is a measure of both how frequent the term is in the corpus and how "distinctive" it is in distinguishing between different topics.
    *   When a particular topic is selected, the bar chart changes to show the top-30 most "relevant" terms for the selected topic. The relevance metric is controlled by the parameter Î»Î», which can be adjusted with a slider above the bar chart.
        *   Setting the Î»Î» parameter close to 1.0 (the default) will rank the terms solely according to their probability within the topic.
        *   Setting Î»Î» close to 0.0 will rank the terms solely according to their "distinctiveness" or "exclusivity" within the topic â i.e., terms that occur _only_ in this topic, and do not occur in other topics.
        *   Setting Î»Î» to values between 0.0 and 1.0 will result in an intermediate ranking, weighting term probability and exclusivity accordingly.
*   Rolling the mouse over a term in the bar chart on the right will cause the topic circles to resize in the plot on the left, to show the strength of the relationship between the topics and the selected term.

A more detailed explanation of the pyLDAvis visualization can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LDAvis/vignettes/details.pdf). Unfortunately, though the data used by gensim and pyLDAvis are the same, they don't use the same ID numbers for topics. If you need to match up topics in gensim's LdaMulticore object and pyLDAvis' visualization, you have to dig through the terms manually.



29. [Another great article about LDA](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/beginners-guide-to-topic-modeling-in-python/), including algorithm, parameters!! And

    **Parameters of LDA**

1. **Alpha and Beta Hyperparameters** â alpha represents document-topic density and Beta represents topic-word density. Higher the value of alpha, documents are composed of more topics and lower the value of alpha, documents contain fewer topics. On the other hand, higher the beta, topics are composed of a large number of words in the corpus, and with the lower value of beta, they are composed of few words.
2. **Number of Topics** â Number of topics to be extracted from the corpus. Researchers have developed approaches to obtain an optimal number of topics by using Kullback Leibler Divergence Score. I will not discuss this in detail, as it is too mathematical. For understanding, one can refer to this[1] original paper on the use of KL divergence.
3. **Number of Topic Terms** â Number of terms composed in a single topic. It is generally decided according to the requirement. If the problem statement talks about extracting themes or concepts, it is recommended to choose a higher number, if problem statement talks about extracting features or terms, a low number is recommended.
4. Number of Iterations / passes â Maximum number of iterations allowed to LDA algorithm for convergence.

    Ways to improve LDA:

1. Reduce dimentionality of document-term matrix
2. Frequency filter
3. POS filter
4. Batch wise LDA

31. [Diff between lda and mallet](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gensim/_VO4otCV6cU) - The inference algorithms in Mallet and Gensim are indeed different. Mallet uses Gibbs Sampling which is more precise than Gensim's faster and online Variational Bayes. There is a way to get relatively performance by increasing number of passes.

    11. [The default for alpha is 5.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44561609/how-does-mallet-set-its-default-hyperparameters-for-lda-i-e-alpha-and-beta)0 divided by the number of topics. You can think of this as five "pseudo-words" of weight on the uniform distribution over topics. If the document is short, we expect to stay closer to the uniform prior. If the document is long, we would feel more confident moving away from the prior.
    12. With hyperparameter optimization, the `alpha` value for each topic can be different. They usually become smaller than the default setting.
    13. The default value for `beta` is 0.01. This means that each topic has a weight on the uniform prior equal to the size of the vocabulary divided by 100. This seems to be a good value. With optimization turned on, the value rarely changes by more than a factor of two.

Paper: [Evaluating topic coherence](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/03a0/62fdcd13c9287a2d4e1d6d057fd2e083281c.pdf) - **Abstract**: Topic models extract representative word setsâcalled topicsâfrom word counts in documents without requiring any semantic annotations. Topics are not guaranteed to be well interpretable, therefore, coherence measures have been proposed to distinguish between good and bad topics. Studies of topic coherence so far are limited to measures that score pairs of individual words. For the first time, we include coherence measures from scientific philosophy that score pairs of more complex word subsets and apply them to topic scoring.

    **Conclusion**: The results of the first experiment show that if we are using the one-any, any-any and one-all coherences directly for optimization they are leading to meaningful word sets. The second experiment shows that these coherence measures are able to outperform the UCI coherence as well as the UMass coherence on these generated word sets. For evaluating LDA topics any-any and one-any coherences perform slightly better than the UCI coherence. The correlation of the UMass coherence and the human ratings is not as high as for the other coherences.

19. Code: [Evaluating topic coherence, using gensim umass or cv parameter](https://datascienceplus.com/evaluation-of-topic-modeling-topic-coherence/) - To conclude, there are many other approaches to evaluate Topic models such as Perplexity, but its poor indicator of the quality of the topics.Topic Visualization is also a good way to assess topic models. Topic Coherence measure is a good way to compare difference topic models based on their human-interpretability.The `u_mass` and `c_v` topic coherences capture the optimal number of topics by giving the interpretability of these topics a number called coherence score.

Char-based RNN LMs can mimic grammatically correct sequences for a wide range of languages, require bigger hidden layer and computationally more expensive while word-based RNN LMs train faster and generate more coherent texts and yet even these generated texts are far from making actual sense.

Full results for every language that I tested are in table at the end of blog post & on [Github](https://gist.github.com/alexott/dd43fa8d1db4b8202d55c6325b2c69c2). From them I can make following conclusions:



*   all detectors are equally good on some languages, such as, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Greek, Arabic, Farsi, Georgian, etc. - for them the accuracy of detection is between 98 & 100%;
*   CLD is much better in detection of "rare" languages, especially for languages, that are similar to more frequently used - Afrikaans vs Dutch, Azerbaijani vs. Turkish, Malay vs. Indonesian, Nepali vs. Hindi, Russian vs Bulgarian, etc. (it could be result of imbalance of training data - I need to check the source dataset);
*   for "major" languages not mentioned above (English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch) the fastText results are much better than CLD's, and in many cases lingid.py's & OpenNLP's;
*   for many languages results for "compressed" fastText model are slightly worse than results from "full" model (mostly only by 1-2%, but could be higher, like for Kazakh when difference is 33%), but there are languages where the situation is different - results for compressed are slight better than for full (for example, for German or Dutch);

        OpenNLP has many misclassifications for Cyrillic languages - Russian/Ukrainian, ...


Rafael Oliveira [posted on FB](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1174547215919768/permalink/1702123316495486/?comment_id=1704414996266318&reply_comment_id=1705159672858517&notif_id=1507280476710677&notif_t=group_comment) a simple diagram that shows what languages are detected better by CLD & what is better handled by fastText

Here are some additional notes about differences in behavior of detectors that I observe during analyzing results:



*   fastText is more reliable than CLD on the short texts;
*   fastText models & langid.py detect language as Hebrew instead of Jewish as in CLD. Similarly, CLD uses 'in' for Indonesian language instead of standard 'id' used by fastText & langid.py;
*   fastText distinguish between Cyrillic- & Latin-based versions of Serbian;
*   CLD tends to incorporate geographical & person's names into detection results - for example, blog post in German about travel to Iceland is detected as Icelandic, while fastText detects it as German;
*   In extended detection mode CLD tends to select more rare language, like, Galician or Catalan over Spanish, Serbian instead of Russian, etc.
*   OpenNLP isn't very good in detection for short texts.

The models released by fastText development team provides very good alternative to existing language detection tools, like, Google's CLD & langid.py - for most of "popular" languages, these models provides higher detection accuracy comparing to other tools, combined with high speed of detection (drawback of langid.py). Even using "compressed" model it's possible to reach good detection accuracy. Although for some less frequently used languages, CLD & langid.py may show better results.

Performance-wise, the langid.py is much slower than both CLD & fastText. On average, CLD requires 0.5-1 ms to perform language detection. For fastText & langid.py I don't have precise numbers yet, only approximates based on speed of execution of corresponding programs.

7. Really good: [BLUE - what is it, how it is calculated?](https://slator.com/technology/how-bleu-measures-translation-and-why-it-matters/)

    â[BLEU] looks at the presence or absence of particular words, as well as the ordering and the degree of distortionâhow much they actually are separated in the output.â


    BLEUâs evaluation system requires two inputs: (i) a numerical translation closeness metric, which is then assigned and measured against (ii) a corpus of human reference translations.


    BLEU averages out various metrics using an [n-gram method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram), a probabilistic language model often used in computational linguistics.


    

<p id="gdcalert244" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image240.png).

![alt_text](images/image240.png "image_tooltip")



    The result is typically measured on a 0 to 1 scale, with 1 as the hypothetical âperfectâ translation. Since the human reference, against which MT is measured, is always made up of multiple translations, even a human translation would not score a 1, however. Sometimes the score is expressed as multiplied by 100 or, as in the case of Google mentioned above, by 10.


    a BLEU score offers more of an intuitive rather than an absolute meaning and is best used for relative judgments: âIf we get a BLEU score of 35 (out of 100), it seems okay, but it actually has no correlation to the quality of the output in any meaningful sense. If itâs less than 15, we can probably safely say itâs very bad. If itâs greater than 60, we probably have some mistake in our testing! So it will generally fall in there.â


     âTypically, if you have multiple [human translation] references, the BLEU score tends to be higher. So if you hear a very large BLEU scoreâsomeone gives you a value that seems very highâyou can ask them if there are multiple references being used; because, then, that is the reason that the score is actually higher.â

*   **[Kafka in a nutshell](https://medium.com/@aiven_io/apache-kafka-in-a-nutshell-df10dfcc7dc) - **But even these solutions came up short in some cases. For example, RabbitMQ stores messages in DRAM until the DRAM is completely consumed, at which point messages are written to disk, [severely impacting performance](https://blog.mavenhive.in/which-one-to-use-and-when-rabbitmq-vs-apache-kafka-7d5423301b58).

    Also, the routing logic of AMQP can be fairly complicated as opposed to Apache Kafka. For instance, each consumer simply decides which messages to read in Kafka.


    In addition to message routing simplicity, there are places where developers and DevOps staff prefer Apache Kafka for its high throughput, scalability, performance, and durability; although, developers still swear by all three systems for various reasons.

*   [Apache Kafka Kafka](https://medium.com/develbyte/introduction-to-zookeeper-bcda7ef136cd) is a pub-sub messaging system. It uses Zookeeper to detect crashes, to implement topic discovery, and to maintain production and consumption state for topics.
